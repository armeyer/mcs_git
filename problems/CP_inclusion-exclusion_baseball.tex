\begin{problem}
There are 180 games in the baseball season.  A certain player's season
satisfies the following condiitions:

\begin{itemize}
\item He rests (does not play) every 9th game---beginning with game 9.

\item He hits a home run every 4th game that he plays---beginning with
  game 4.

\item He strikes out every 5th game (if he is not resting)---beginning
  with game 5

\item He cannot strike out and hit a home run in the same game.
\end{itemize}

In how many games does the player either not hit a home run or not
strikeout (including days he is resting)?

\begin{solution}
We want the union of the sets: $A$ = games he rests, $B$ = games he
does not hit a home run, and $C$ = games he does not strike out.  By
the inclusion/exclusion principle:
\[
\card{A \union B \union C} = \card{A} + |B| + |C| - |A \intersect B| -
|B \intersect C| - |A \intersect C| + |A \intersect B \intersect C| =
20 + 135 + 144 - 20 - 108 - 20 + 20 = 171,
\]
because,
\begin{align*}
\card{B \intersect C} & = 180 - \card{\overline{B \intersect C}}\\
\overline{B \intersect C} & = \bar{B} \union \bar{C}\\
\card{\bar{B} \union \bar{C}} & = \card{\bar{B}} + \card{\bar{C}} -\card{\bar{B} \intersect \bar{C}}\\
45 + 36 - 9 = 72.
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
\end{problem}
