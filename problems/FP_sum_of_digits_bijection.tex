\begin{problem}
Let $L_n$ be the length-$n$ sequences of digits $\Zintv{0}{9}$ whose
sum of digits is less than $9n/2$, and let $G_n$ be the
length-$n$ sequences of digits $\Zintv{0}{9}$ whose sum of digits is
greater than $9n/2$.  For example, $\mtt{2134} \in L_4$ and
$\mtt{9786} \in G_4$.

Describe a simple bijection between $L_n$ and $G_n$.  Prove carefully
that your mapping is a bijection by verifying that it is a function,
total, injective, and surjective.

\begin{solution}
Map the length-$n$ sequence $d_1 d_2 \ldots d_n$ to $e_1 e_2 \ldots
e_n$ where $e_i = 9 - d_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$.

Since $\sum_{i=1}^n e_i = \sum_{i=1}^n (9-d_i) = 9n - \sum_{i=1}^n
d_i$, the sum of the $d_i$'s is less than $9n/2$ iff the sum
of the $e_i$'s is greater than $9n/2$.  So this mapping
defines a bijection between $L_n$ and $G_n$.
