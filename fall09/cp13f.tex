\section*{Expectation}
The \term{expected value} of a random variable $R$ defined on a sample
space, $\sspace$, is:
\[
\expect{R} = \sum_{\omega \in \sspace} R(\omega) \pr{\omega} = \sum_{v \in \range{R}} v \pr{R=v}
\]

\subsection*{Mean Time to Failure}

If a biased coin with probability, $p$, of
Heads is repeatedly flipped until a Head comes up, where the flips are
mutually independent, then the expected number of flips is $1/p$.

\subsection*{Conditional Expectation}

The expected value of a random variable, $R$, \emph{given event $A$}, is
\[
\expcond{R}{A} \eqdef \sum_{x \in \range{R}} x \cdot \prcond{R = x}{A}
\]
\iffalse

So $\expect{R} = \expcond{R}{\sspace}$ where $\sspace$ is the sample space
for $R$.
\fi

\subsection*{Law of Total Expectation}
Let $A_1,A_2,\dots$ be a partition of the sample space.  Then
\[
\expect{R} = \sum_i \expcond{R}{A_i} \pr{A_i}.
\]

\subsection*{Linearity of Expectation}
For any random variables $R_1, \dots, R_k$ and constants $a_1, \dots, a_k
\in \reals$,
\[
\expect{\sum_{i=1}^k a_iR_i} = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i\expect{R_i}.
\]
(The $R_i$ do \emph{not} have to be independent.)

\subsection*{Product of Expectations} If random
variables $R_1, R_2, \dots, R_k$ are \emph{mutually} independent, then
\[
\expect{\prod_{i=1}^k R_i} = \prod_{i=1}^k \expect{R_i}.
\]
