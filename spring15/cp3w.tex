%\textbf{Supplemental problem:}



%\begin{staffnotes}
%Tell students not to worry if they don't get through the next two
%problems.  The first one about finite ordinals gives more practice
%with the membership and containment relations, but we won't make
%further use of the ordinals.  The second is more practice with
%predicate formulas than learning about sets.

%\textbf{Extra practice with set formulas}:

%\pinput{CP_finite_ordinals}

%\pinput{PS_binary_relations_on_a_set}  renamed TP; stupid problem

%\pinput{CP_web_search}  on pset 3
