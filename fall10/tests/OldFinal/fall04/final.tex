\begin{problem}[13 points]
Give an inductive proof that the Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$
are relatively prime for all $n \geq 0$.  The Fibonacci numbers are
defined as follows:
%
\[
F_0 = 0 \qquad F_1 = 1 \qquad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \quad \text{(for $n \geq 2$)}
\]
\end{problem}

\solution{We use induction on $n$.  Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that $F_n$
and $F_{n+1}$ are relatively prime.

\noindent \textit{Base case:} $P(0)$ is true because $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$
are relatively prime.

\noindent \textit{Inductive step:} Assume that $P(n)$ is true where $n
\geq 0$; that is, $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ are relatively prime.  We must
show that $F_{n+1}$ and $F_{n+2}$ are relatively prime as well.  If
$F_{n+1}$ and $F_{n+2}$ had a common divisor $d > 1$, then $d$ would
also divide the linear combination $F_{n+2} - F_{n+1} = F_n$,
contradicting the assumption that $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ are relatively
prime.  So $F_{n+1}$ and $F_{n+2}$ are relatively prime.

The theorem follows by induction.}

$G_1$, $G_3$ is the double of $G_2$, and so forth.  Use induction on
$n$ to prove that $G_n$ is bipartite for all $n \geq 1$.

\solution{We use induction.  Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that $G_n$
is bipartite.

\noindent \textit{Base case:} $P(1)$ is true because $G_1$ is
bipartite by assumption.

\noindent \textit{Inductive step:} For $n \geq 1$, we assume $P(n)$ in
order to prove $P(n+1)$.  The graph $G_{n+1}$ consists of two
subgraphs isomorphic to $G_n$ with edges joining corresponding
vertices.  Remove these extra edges.  By the assumption $P(n)$, we can
color each vertex of one subgraph black or white so that adjacent
vertices get different colors.  If we color the corresponding vertices
in the other subgraph oppositely, then adjacent vertices get different
colors within that subgraph as well.  And now if we add back the extra
edges, each of these joins a white vertex and a black vertex.
Therefore, $G_{n+1}$ is bipartite.

The theorem follows from the principle of induction.}

\begin{problem}[12 points]
Suppose that you roll five 6-sided dice that are fair and mutually
independent.  For the problems below, answers alone are sufficient,
but we can award partial credit only if you show your work.  Also, you
do not need to simplify your answers; you may leave factorials,
binomial coefficients, and arithmetic expressions unevaluated.

\bparts

\ppart What is the probability that all five dice show different
values?

Example: $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ is a roll of this type, but $(1, 1, 2, 3,
4)$ is not.

\solution[\vspace{1.75in}]{The probability space is the uniform
distribution on the $6^5$ possible numbers rolled on the five
(distinguishable) dice.  So the probability that all dice are different is
the number of outcomes in which the dice have distinct values divided by $6^5$.
There are $\paren{6}_5 = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$ such outcomes so
\[
\pr{\text{all rolls distinct}}= \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot
2}{6^5} = \frac{5!}{6^4}
\]

An alternative approach uses the observation that the conditional
probability that the $i+1$st die value differs from the preceding rolls,
given that the first $i$ values differ, is $(6-i)/6$ for $1 \leq i \leq
4$, and the probability that all five values are different is the product
of these conditional probabilities, namely
\[
\pr{\text{all rolls distinct}} = \frac56 \cdot \frac46 \cdot\frac36 \cdot\frac26 = \frac{5!}{6^4}
\]

}

\ppart What is the probability that two dice show the same value and
the remaining three dice all show different values?

Example: $(6, 1, 6, 2, 3)$ is a roll of this type, but $(1, 1, 2, 2,
3)$ and $(4, 4, 4, 5, 6)$ are not.

\solution[\vspace{1.75in}]{
There are $\binom{5}{2}$ possible pairs of rolls that might have the same value
and 6 possibilities for what this value is.  There $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3$
possible distinct values for the remaining three rolls.  So
\[
\pr{\text{exactly two values the same}} = \frac{\dbinom{5}{2} \cdot 6
\cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{6^5} = \frac{100}{6^3}
\]

An alternative way to count is: there are $\binom{6}{4}$ sets of four
values among the five dice, 4 choices for which of these values is
repeated, and by the Bookkeeper rule, $\binom{5}{2,1,1,1}= 5!/2$
permutations of a sequence consisting of five values, one of which appears
twice. So,
\[
\pr{\text{exactly two values the same}} = \frac{\dbinom{6}{4} \cdot 4
\cdot 5!/2}{6^5} = \frac{100}{6^3}
\]

}

\ppart What is the probability that two dice show one value, two
different dice show a second value, and the remaining die shows a
third value?

Example: $(6, 1, 2, 1, 2)$ is a roll of this type, but $(4, 4, 4, 4,
5)$ and $(5, 5, 5, 6, 6)$ are not.

\solution{There are $\binom{6}{2}$ sets of two values that might be
duplicated.  There are $\binom{5}{2}$ rolls where larger duplicated value
may come up and $\binom{3}{2}$ remaining rolls where the smaller
duplicated value may come up.  There is only 1 remaining roll where the
nonduplicated value may then come up, and 4 remaining values it could
take.  So,
\[
\pr{\text{exactly two pairs of same values}} =
\frac{\dbinom{6}{2} \cdot \dbinom52 \cdot \dbinom32 \cdot 4}{6^5} = \frac{50}{6^3}
\]

Alternatively, there are $\binom{6}{3}$ sets of three values among the
five dice, 3 choices for which of these values is not repeated, and by the
Bookkeeper rule, $\binom{5}{2,2,1}$ permutations of a sequence consisting
of five values, two of which appear twice. So,
\[
\pr{\text{exactly two pairs of same values}} = \frac{\dbinom{6}{3} \cdot 3
\cdot \dbinom{5}{2,2,1}}{6^5} = \frac{50}{6^3}

\ppart Below the display, there are five buttons numbered 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5.  The player may press a sequence of buttons; however, the same
button can not be pressed twice in a row.  How many different
sequences of $n$ button-presses are possible?

\solution[\newpage]{There are 5 choices for the first button
press and 4 for each subsequence press.  Therefore, the number of
different sequences of $n$ button presses is $5 \cdot 4^{n-1}$.}

\ppart Each button press scrambles the colored squares in a
complicated, but nonrandom way.  Prove that there exist two
\textit{different} sequences of 32 button presses that both produce
the \textit{same} configuration, if the puzzle is initially in the
state shown above.  (Hint:  $4^{32} = 16^{16} > 16!$)

\solution{We use the Pigeonhole Principle.  Let $A$ be the set of all
sequences of 32 button presses, let $B$ be the set of all
configurations, and let $f : A \to B$ map each sequence of button
presses to the configuration that results.  Now:
%
\[
\size{A} > 4^{32} > 16! > \size{B}
\]
%
Thus, by the Pigeonhole Principle, $f$ is not injective; that is,
there exist distinct elements $a_1, a_2 \in A$ such taht $f(a_1) =
f(a_2)$.  In other words, there are two different sequences of button
presses that produce the same configuration}.

MIT students sometimes delay laundry for a few days.  Assume all
random values described below are mutually independent.

\bparts

\ppart A \term{busy} student must complete 3 problem sets before doing
laundry.  Each problem set requires 1 day with probability $2/3$ and 2
days with probability $1/3$.  Let $B$ be the number of days a busy
student delays laundry.  What is $\ex{B}$?

Example: If the first problem set requires 1 day and the second and
third problem sets each require 2 days, then the student delays for $B
= 5$ days.

\solution[\vspace{2.5in}]{ The expected time to complete a problem
set is:
%
\[
1 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}

    & = 4
\end{align*}
}

\ppart A \term{relaxed} student rolls a fair, 6-sided die in the
morning.  If he rolls a 1, then he does his laundry immediately (with
zero days of delay).  Otherwise, he delays for one day and repeats the
experiment the following morning.  Let $R$ be the number of days a
relaxed student delays laundry.  What is $\ex{R}$?

Example: If the student rolls a 2 the first morning, a 5 the second
morning, and a 1 the third morning, then he delays for $R = 2$ days.

\solution[\newpage]{If we regard doing laundry as a failure, then the
mean time to failure is $1 / (1/6) = 6$.  However, this counts the day
laundry is done, so the number of days delay is $6 - 1 = 5$.
Alternatively, we could derive the answer as follows:
%
\begin{align*}
\ex{R}
    & = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \pr{R > k} \\
    & = \frac{5}{6} + \paren{\frac{5}{6}}^2 + \paren{\frac{5}{6}}^3 + \ldots \\

            \paren{1 + \frac{5}{6} + \paren{\frac{5}{6}}^2 + \ldots} \\
    & = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - 5/6} \\
    & = 5
\end{align*}
}

\ppart Before doing laundry, an \term{unlucky} student must recover
from illness for a number of days equal to the product of the numbers
rolled on two fair, 6-sided dice.  Let $U$ be the expected number of
days an unlucky student delays laundry.  What is $\ex{U}$?

Example: If the rolls are 5 and 3, then the student delays for $U =
15$ days.

\solution[\vspace{3in}]{Let $D_1$ and $D_2$ be the two die rolls.
Recall that a die roll has expectation $7/2$.  Thus:
