\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Fun with coins

Answer these following questions about flipping a fair coin.

\bparts

\ppart
What is the probability that you will throw Tails \emph{forever} with
a fair coin?

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}

The probablity that you will throw $n$ Tails in a row is $(1/2)^{n}$.
As $n$ approaches infinity, this goes to~0.

\ppart

What is the probability that you will throw at least one Head when you
keep throwing a fair coin \emph{forever}?

\begin{solution}
1

This event happens exactly when you don't throw Tails forever.  Since
we know the probability of throwing Tails forever is 0 from the
previous part, the probability of at least one head is $1-0 = 1$.
\end{solution}
