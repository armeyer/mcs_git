\def\clauses{\mathcal{S}}

\begin{problem}
  A \term{literal} is a propositional variable or its negation.  A
  \emph{$k$-clause} is an $\QOR$ of $k$ literals, with no variable
  occurring more than once in the clause.  For example,
\[
P \QOR \bar{Q} \QOR \bar{R} \QOR V,
\]
is a 4-clause, but
\[
\bar{V} \QOR \bar{Q} \QOR \bar{X} \QOR V,
\]
is not, since $V$ appears twice.

Let $\clauses$ be a set of $n$ distinct $k$-clauses involving $v$
variables.  The variables in different $k$-clauses may overlap or be
completely different, so $k \leq v \leq nk$.

A random assignment of true/false values will be made independently to
each of the $v$ variables, with true and false assignments equally likely.
Write formulas in $n$, $k$ and $v$ in answer to the first two parts
below.

\bparts

\ppart What is the probability that any particular $k$-clause in
$\clauses$ is true under the random assignment?

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
A $k$-clause is true unless all $k$ of its literals are
false.  Thus, it is true with probability:
\[
1 - \paren{\frac{1}{2}}^k.
\]
Since variables are assigned truth values independently, neither $n$ nor
$v$ nor the fact that we're considering the last clause is relevant.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{partexpectclauses} What is the expected number of true
$k$-clauses in $\clauses$?

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
  Let $T_i$ be an indicator for the event that the $i$-th $k$-clause is
  true.  Then the number of true propositions is $\sum_{i=1}^n T_i$, so
  the expected number is
\begin{equation}\label{expectclauses}
n\expect{T_1} = n\paren{1 - \frac{1}{2^k}} = n - \frac{n}{2^k}.
\end{equation}
\end{solution}

%\examspace

\ppart A set of propositions is \term{satisfiable} iff there is an
assignment to the variables that makes all of the propositions true.  Use
your answer to part~\eqref{partexpectclauses} to prove that if $n < 2^k$,
then $\clauses$ is satisfiable.

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
  For $n <2^k$, the expected number of true clauses given
  in~\eqref{expectclauses} will be $> n-1$.  But a random variable
  cannot always be less than its expectation, so there must be some
  assignment making $> n-1$ of the clauses true, that is, an
  assignment for which all $n$ of the clauses in $\clauses$ are true.
\end{solution}
