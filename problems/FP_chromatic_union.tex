\begin{problem}
For simple graphs $G$ and $H$, explain why the chromatic number
$\chi(G \union H)$ of the union of $G$ and $H$ is at most $\chi(G)
\cdot \chi(H)$.

\begin{solution}
Color each vertex $v \in \vertices{G}$, with a new ``color'' that is a
pair consisting of the color of $v$ in a minimal coloring of $G$ and
its color in a minimal coloring of $H$.  Clearly the number of colors
used will be at most $\chi(G) \cdot \chi(H)$.

Now let's prove that this is a valid coloring.  Let $u,v$ be two
adjacent vertices in $G \union H$.  This means by definition that they
must be adjacent in $G$ or in $H$.  Suppose wlog that $u$ and $v$ are
adjacent in $G$.  Then the colors of $u$ and $v$ must differ in any
coloring of $G$, so the pair colorings of $u$ and $v$ will differ in
their first coordinate.  So adjacent vertices in $G \union H$ will be
assigned different colors, as required.
\end{solution}
