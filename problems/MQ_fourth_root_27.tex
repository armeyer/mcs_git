\begin{problem}\label{generprob}
   Prove that $\sqrt[4]{27}$ is irrational.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
  Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\sqrt[4]{27}$ is rational.
  Under this assumption, there exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that
\[
\sqrt[4]{27} =  \frac{a}{b},
\] 
where $a$ and $b$ have no common factor.  Now we prove that $a$ and
$b$ have 3 as a common factor, a contradiction.

\begin{align*}
\sqrt[4]{27} & = \frac{a}{b}, & \text{(by assumption)}\\
27           & = \frac{a^{4}}{b^{4}}, & \text{(taking 4th powers)}\\
27b^{4}      & = a^{4}.
\end{align*}
The left-hand side of this equation has 3 as a factor, so 3 is a
factor of the right-hand side $a^{4}$ which, by unique
factorization, implies that 3 is also a factor of $a$.

In particular, $a = 3c$ for some integer $c$.  Thus,
\begin{align*}
27b^{4} & = (3c)^4 = 3^4c^{4},\\
b^{4}  & = 3c^{4} & \text{(dividing by 27)}.
\end{align*}
The right-hand side of the last equation has 3 as a factor, so the
left-hand side $b^{4}$ does as well, which implies that $b$ does too.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}
