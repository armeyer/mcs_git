\ppart[1] Describe an isomorphism between graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$,
and another isomorphism between $G_2$ and $G_3$.

\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}

The following is a possible bijection from $G_1$ to $G_2$: \newline
\begin{align*}
a &\longrightarrow f, \\
b &\longrightarrow g, \\
c &\longrightarrow h, \\
d &\longrightarrow j, \\
e &\longrightarrow i \\
\end{align*}

The following is a possible bijection from $G_2$ to $G_3$: \newline
\begin{align*}
f &\longrightarrow n, \\
g &\longrightarrow k, \\
h &\longrightarrow m, \\
i &\longrightarrow l, \\
j &\longrightarrow o
\end{align*}

\end{solution}

\ppart Why does part $(a)$ imply that there is an isomorphism between
graphs $G_1$ and $G_3$?

\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}
The composition of an isomorphism from $G_1$ to
  $G_2$ with an isomorphism from $G_2$ to $G_3$ is an isomorphism from
  $G_1$ to $G_3$.
\end{solution}

Let $G$ and $H$ be planar graphs.  An embedding $E_G$ of $G$ is isomorphic
to an embedding $E_H$ of $H$ iff there is an isomorphism from $G$ to $H$
that also maps each face of $E_G$ to a face of $E_H$.

\ppart One of the embeddings pictured above is not isomorphic to either
of the others.  Which one?  Briefly explain why.

\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}
  The embedding pictured in $G_2$ is not isomorphic to either of the other
  embeddings pictured because the $G_2$ embedding has a face with four
  edges, while neither of others do.
\end{solution}

\ppart Explain why all embeddings of two isomorphic planar graphs must
have the same number of faces.

\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}
$f=2+v-e.$
