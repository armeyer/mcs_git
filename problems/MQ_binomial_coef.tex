\begin{problem}

Find the coefficients of 
 $x^{10}y^5$ in $(19x+4y)^{15}$

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{15}{10}19^{10}4^5.
\]

When $(19x+4y)^{15}$ is expressed as a sum of powers of the summands
$19x$ and $4y$, the coefficient of $(19x)^{10}(4y)^5$ is
$\binom{15}{10}$, so the coefficient of $x^{10}y^5$ is this binomial
coefficient times $19^{10}\cdot 4^5$.
\end{solution}
