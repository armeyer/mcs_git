\begin{problem}

There is a newly developed test called \EQ \textit{(Emotional
  Quotient)}, that is used to decide whether or not you will be able
to make friends outside MIT.  \EQ is expressed as a nonnegative
integer.  The average \EQ over all humans is 1000.

\bparts

\ppart Knowing only the average $\EQ$, find an upper bound for the
fraction of humans that have $\EQ \geq 1500$.

\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}
We can use the Markov's inequality to obtain the upper bound.
\[
\pr{X\geq c\expect{X}} \leq \frac{1}{c}
\]

Setting $c=1500/1000= 3/2$, we obtain the upper bound $2/3$.

\end{solution}


\ppart Give an example of a distribution that achieves the upper bound on part a.

\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}

One possible example is $3$ humans, $2$ with \EQ equals to $1500$ and $1$ with \EQ equal to $0$.

\end{solution}
 

\ppart Assuming that the standard deviation of $\EQ$ is $100$, what
fraction of humans can have $\EQ \geq 3000$?

\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}
We use the Chebyshev bound: 
\[
\pr{ \card{ X - \expect{X} } \geq  c\sigma_x\} \leq \frac1{c^2}
\]
with $c=20$ to get an upper bound of $\1/400$, since $\pr{X -
  \expect{X} \leq -1000] = 0 $ because $\expect{X} = 2000$ and \EQ is
expressed as a nonnegative integer.
  
\end{solution}

\ppart Give an example of a distribution that achieves the upper bound on part c.
