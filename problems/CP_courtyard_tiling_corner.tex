\ppart\label{cornertile_induction} Prove by induction that a $2^n \times
2^n$ courtyard with a $1 \times 1$ statue of Bill in {\em a corner} can be
covered with L-shaped tiles.  (Do not assume or reprove the (stronger)
result in the Notes that Bill can be placed anywhere.  The point of this
problem is to show a different induction hypothesis that works.)
\begin{solution}

Let $P(n)$ be the proposition Bill can be placed in a corner of
 $2^n \times 2^n$ courtyard with a proper tiling of the remainder with
L-shaped tiles.

\textbf{Base case:} $P(0)$ is true because Bill fills the whole courtyard.

\textbf{Inductive step:} Assume that $P(n)$ is true for some
$n \geq 0$; that is, there exists a tiling of the $2^n \times 2^n$
courtyard leaving Bill in a corner.

Divide the $2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1}$ courtyard into four quadrants, each
$2^n \times 2^n$.  One quadrant will contain the corner designated for
Bill.  By induction hypothesis, we can get Bill into some corner of the
quadrant, which means we can actually get him into \emph{any} desired
corner of the quadrant by rotating the tiling of the quadrant.  So place
Bill in the designated corner of the quandrant, and tile the rest of the
quadrant.

Now tile the remaining three quadrants leaving a space for Bill the
quadrant corners that are in the middle of the whole $2^{n+1} \times
2^{n+1}$ courtyard (as in the diagram in the Notes).  These three spaces
for an L-shape that that can be filled with a single L-shaped tile,
completing the full courtyard tiling.  This proves $P(n+1)$, completing
the proof by induction that a courtyard with side length any power of 2
can be tiled with Bill in a corner.

\end{solution}

\ppart Use the result of part~\eqref{cornertile_induction} to prove the
original claim that there is a tiling with Bill in the middle.
\begin{solution}
To put Bill in the middle, tile each of the four quadrants leaving empty
the quadrant corner in the midde of the full courtyard.  This leaves the
four central squares of the full courtyard empty, so fill three of these
squares with an L-shaped tile.  This leaves a single central square
untiled for Bill.
\end{solution}
