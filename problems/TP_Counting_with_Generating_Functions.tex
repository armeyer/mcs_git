\begin{problem}
Let $a_{n}$ be the number of ways to make change for \$$n$ using \$2
and \$3 coins.  For example, $a_{5} = 1$ because the only way to make
change for \$5 is with one \$2 coin and one \$3 coin, but $a_{6} = 2$
because there are two ways to make change for \$6, namely using three
\$2 coins or using two \$3 coins.

Express the generating function for the sequence of $a_{n}$'s as a
rational function (quotient of products of polynomials).  You need not
simplify your formula or solve for $a_n$.

\begin{solution}
\[
1/(1-x^2)(1-x^3)
\]

Using \$2 coins, there is only one way to make change for \$$n$ when
$n$ is even, and no way to do it when $n$ is odd.  So the generating
function for the number of ways to make change for \$$n$ using only
\$2 coins is
\[
    1+x^2+x^4+x^6+\cdots = \frac{1}{1-x^2}
\]
Similarly, the generating function for the number of ways to make
change for \$$n$ using only \$3 coins is
\[
\frac{1}{1-x^3}
\]

The generating function for the number of ways to make change using
both kinds of coins is the product of the generating functions for
each kind of coin.
\end{solution}
