\begin{problem}
Prove that there is an irrational number, $a$, such that $a^{\sqrt{3}}$ is rational.

\hint Consider $\sqrt[3]{2}^{\sqrt{3}}$ and argue by cases.

\inhandout{\instatements{\newpage}}
\begin{solution}
Case 1: [$\sqrt[3]{2}^{\sqrt{3}}$ is rational].  Let $a = \sqrt[3]{2}$.
We know that $a$ is irrational from a Class Problem of Week 1, Friday.

Case 2: [$\sqrt[3]{2}^{\sqrt{3}}$ is irrational].  Let $a =
\sqrt[3]{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$.  Then $a$ is irrational by case hypothesis, and
\[
a^{\sqrt{3}} = \paren{\sqrt[3]{2}^{\sqrt{3}}}^{\sqrt{3}} =
      \sqrt[3]{2}^{\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}^3 = 2,
\]
which is rational.  So we have found the required $a$
nin this case also.

So in any case, there will be irrational $a$ such that $a^{\sqrt{3}}$ is
rational.
