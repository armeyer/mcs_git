\begin{problem}
  Extend the binary gcd procedure of Problem~\bref{PS_binary_gcd} to
  obtain a new pulverizer that uses only division by 2 and
  subtraction.

\hint{After the binary gcd procedure has factored out 2's, it starts
  computing the $\gcd(a,b)$ for numbers $a,b$ at least one of which is
  odd.  It does this by successively updating a pair of numbers
  $(x,y)$ such that $\gcd(x,y)=\gcd(a,b)$.  Extend the procedure to
  find and update coefficients $u_x,v_x,u_y,v_y$ such that
  \[
  u_xa+v_xb = x \text{ and } u_ya+v_yb = y.
  \]

  To see how to update the coefficients when at least one of $a$ and
  $b$ is odd and $ua+vb$ is even, show that either $u$ and $v$ are
  both even, or else $u-b$ and $v+a$ are both even.}

\begin{solution}
  Here is a simple Python program describing the requested pulverizer.
  The program should be understandable even if you don't know Python.

\begin{verbatim}
#binarygcd-while.py
#   Extended Binary GCD (Binary "Pulverizer")

def binarygcd(a, b):               #a, b > 0
   # returns gcd(a,b) and coefficients ux,vx 
   # such that gcd(a,b) = (ux, vx) dot (a, b)
  x, y, e = a, b, 1
  while  evenp(x) and evenp(y):   #x=a/e, y=b/e
      x, y, e = x//2, y//2, 2*e
  ux, vx, uy, vy = 1, 0, 0, 1
  while (x != y):     #x, y not both even
                      #x = (ux, vx) dot (a/e, b/e)
                     #y = (uy, vy) dot (a/e, b/e)
   if evenp(x):
       x = x//2
       if evenp(ux) and evenp(vx):
         ux, vx = ux//2, vx//2
       else:          #ux-b/e and vx+a/e are even
         ux, vx = (ux - b//e)//2, (vx + a//e)//2
   elif evenp(y):
     x, ux, vx, y, uy, vy = y, uy, vy, x, ux, vx 
          #switch x and y
   elif x > y:
     x, ux, vx = x-y, ux-uy, vx-vy
   else:              #x < y:
     x, ux, vx, y, uy, vy = y, uy, vy, x, ux, vx 
       #switch x and y 
       #x == y
  print("gcd =", e*x, " a =", a, " b =",
              b, " ux =", ux, " vx =", vx)
  return "done"

def evenp(n):
    return n%2 == 0

#========================

#>>> binarygcd(3, 5)
#gcd = 1  a = 3  b = 5  ux = 2  vx = -1
#'done'

#>>> binarygcd(2**3, 2**5)
#gcd = 8  a = 8  b = 32  ux = -3  vx = 1

#>>> binarygcd((2**13)*(3**2)*5*7*(13**2),
                        (2**4)*(5**4)*(11**5))
#gcd = 80  a = 436101120  b = 1610510000
#     ux = -79611116  vx = 21557455

def dot(a, b, u, v):
    return u*a+v*b

#>>> dot(436101120, 1610510000,
               -79611116, 21557455)
#80
