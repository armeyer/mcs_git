\section{Sets}

We've been assuming that the concepts of sets, sequences, and functions are
already familiar ones, and we've mentioned them repeatedly.  Now we'll do a
quick review of the definitions.

\iffalse

Propositions of the sort we've considered so far are good for
reasoning about individual statements, but not so good for reasoning
about a collection of objects.  Let's first review a couple
mathematical tools for grouping objects and then extend our logical
language to cope with such collections.
\fi

Informally, a \term{set} is a bunch of objects, which are called the
\term{elements} of the set.  The elements of a set can be just about
anything: numbers, points in space, or even other sets.  The conventional
way to write down a set is to list the elements inside curly-braces.  For
example, here are some sets:
%
\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
%\naturals & = & \set{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots} & \text{the} \text{nonnegative integers} \\
A & = & \set{\text{Alex}, \text{Tippy}, \text{Shells}, \text{Shadow}} & \text{dead pets} \\
B & = & \set{\text{red}, \text{blue}, \text{yellow}} & \text{primary colors} \\
C & = & \set{ \set{a, b}, \set{a, c}, \set{b, c}} & \text{a set of sets}
\end{array}
\]
This works fine for small finite sets.  Other sets might be defined by
indicating how to generate a list of them:
\begin{align*}
D & =  \set{1,2,4,8,16,\dots} & \text{the powers of 2}
\end{align*}

The order of elements is not significant, so $\set{x, y}$ and $\set{y, x}$
are the same set written two different ways.  Also, any object is, or is
not, an element of a given set ---there is no notion of an element
appearing more than once in a set.\footnote{It's not hard to develop a
notion of \term{multisets} in which elements can occur more than once, but
multisets are not ordinary sets.}  So writing $\set{x,x}$ is just
indicating the same thing twice, namely, that $x$ is in the set.  In
particular, $\set{x,x} = \set{x}$.

The expression $e \in S$ asserts that $e$ is an element of set $S$.  For
example, $32 \in D$ and $\text{blue} \in B$, but $\text{Tailspin}
\not\in A$ ---yet.

Sets are simple, flexible, and everywhere.  You'll find at least one
set mentioned on almost every page in these notes.

\subsection{Some Popular Sets}

Mathematicians have devised special symbols to represent some common
sets.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\textbf{symbol} & \textbf{set} & \textbf{elements} \\
$\emptyset$ & the empty set & \text{none}\\
$\naturals$ & nonnegative integers & $\set{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$ \\
$\mathbb{Z}$ & integers & $\set{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$ \\
$\mathbb{Q}$ & rational numbers & $\frac{1}{2},\ -\frac{5}{3},\ 16,\ \text{etc.}$ \\
$\reals$ & real numbers & $\pi,\ e,\ -9,\ \sqrt{2},\ \text{etc.}$ \\
$\complexes$ & complex numbers & $i,\ \frac{19}{2},\ \sqrt{2} - 2i,\ \text{etc.}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
A superscript ``$^+$'' restricts a set to its positive elements; for
example, $\reals^+$ denotes the set of positive real numbers.  Similarly,
$\reals^-$ denotes the set of negative reals.

\subsection{Comparing and Combining Sets}

The expression $S \subseteq T$ indicates that set $S$ is a \term{subset}
of set $T$, which means that every element of $S$ is also an element of
$T$ (it could be that $S=T$).  For example, $\naturals \subseteq
\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq
\reals$ (every rational number is a real number), but $\complexes
\not\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ (not every complex number is an integer).

As a memory trick, notice that the $\subseteq$ points to the smaller set,
just like a $\leq$ sign points to the smaller number.  Actually, this
connection goes a little further: there is a symbol $\subset$ analogous to
$<$.  Thus, $S \subset T$ means that $S$ is a subset of $T$, but the two
are \emph{not} equal.  So $A \subseteq A$, but $A \not\subset A$, for
every set $A$.

There are several ways to combine sets.  Let's define a couple of sets for
use in examples:
%
\begin{align*}
X & \eqdef \set{1, 2, 3} \\
Y & \eqdef \set{2, 3, 4}
\end{align*}
%
\begin{itemize}

\item The \textbf{union} of sets $X$ and $Y$ (denoted $X \cup Y$)
contains all elements appearing in $X$ or $Y$ or both.  Thus, $X \cup
Y = \set{1, 2, 3, 4}$.

\item The \textbf{intersection} of $X$ and $Y$ (denoted $X \cap Y$)
consists of all elements that appear in \textit{both} $X$ and $Y$.  So
$X \cap Y = \set{2, 3}$.

\item The \textbf{difference} of $X$ and $Y$ (denoted $X - Y$)
consists of all elements that are in $X$, but not in $Y$.  Therefore,
$X - Y = \set{1}$ and $Y - X = \set{4}$.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Complement of a Set}

Sometimes we are focused on a particular domain, $D$.  Then for any
subset, $A$, of $D$, we define $\overline{A}$ to be the set of all
elements of $D$ \textit{not} in $A$.  That is, $\overline{A} \eqdef D-A$.
The set $\overline{A}$ is called the \term{complement} of $A$.

For example, when the domain we're working with is the real numbers,
the complement of the positive real numbers is the set of negative real
numbers together with zero.  That is,
\[
\overline{\reals^+} = \reals^- \union \set{0}.
\]

It can be helpful to rephrase properties of sets using complements.  For
example, two sets, $A$ and $B$, are aid to be \emph{disjoint} iff they
have no elements in common, that is, $A \intersect B = \emptyset$.  This
is the same as saying that $A$ is a subset of the complement of $B$, that
is, $A \subseteq \overline{B}$.

\subsection{Power Set}

The set of all the subsets of a set, $A$, is called the \term{power set},
$\power(A)$, of $A$.  So $B \in \power(A)$ iff $B \subseteq A$.  For
example, the elements of $\power( \set{1, 2})$ are $\emptyset, \set{1},
\set{2}$ and $\set{1, 2}$.

More generally, if $A$ has $n$ elements, then there are $2^n$ sets in
$\power(A)$.  For this reason, some authors use the notation $2^A$ instead
of $\power(A)$.


\subsection{Set Builder Notation}

One specialized, but important use of predicates is in \term{set
builder notation}.  We'll often want to talk about sets that cannot
be described very well by listing the elements explicitly or by taking
unions, intersections, etc. of easily-described sets.  Set builder
notation often comes to the rescue.  The idea is to define a
\textit{set} using a \textit{predicate}; in particular, the set
consists of all values that make the predicate true.  Here are some
examples of set builder notation:
%
\begin{align*}
A & \eqdef \set{n \in \naturals \suchthat \text{$n$ is a prime and $n =
    4k+1$ for some integer $k$}} \\
B & \eqdef \set{x \in \reals \suchthat x^3 - 3 x + 1 > 0} \\
C & \eqdef \set{a + b i \in \complexes \suchthat a^2 + 2 b^2 \leq 1}
\end{align*}
%
The set $A$ consists of all nonnegative integers $n$ for which the
predicate
%
\begin{center}
``$n$ is a prime and $n = 4k+1$ for some integer $k$''
\end{center}
%
is true.  Thus, the smallest elements of $A$ are:
%
\[
5, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 53, 57, 61, 73, \ldots.
\]
%
Trying to indicate the set $A$ by listing these first few elements
wouldn't work very well; even after ten terms, the pattern is not
obvious!  Similarly, the set $B$ consists of all real numbers $x$ for
which the predicate
%
\[
x^3 - 3x + 1 > 0
\]
%
is true.  In this case, an explicit description of the set $B$ in
terms of intervals would require solving a cubic equation.  Finally,
set $C$ consists of all complex numbers $a + b i$ such that:
%
\[
a^2 + 2 b^2 \leq 1
\]
%
This is an oval-shaped region around the origin in the complex plane.



\section{Sequences}

Sets provide one way to group a collection of objects.  Another way is
in a \term{sequence}, which is a list of objects called \term{terms}
or \term{components}.  Short sequences are commonly described by
listing the elements between parentheses; for example, $(a, b, c)$ is
a sequence with three terms.

While both sets and sequences perform a gathering role, there are
several differences.
%
\begin{itemize}

\item The elements of a set are required to be distinct, but terms in a
sequence can be the same.  Thus, $(a, b, a)$ is a valid sequence of length
three, but $\set{a, b, a}$ is a set with two elements ---not three.

\item The terms in a sequence have a specified order, but the elements
of a set do not.  For example, $(a, b, c)$ and $(a, c, b)$ are
different sequences, but $\set{a, b, c}$ and $\set{a, c, b}$ are the
same set.

\item The empty set is usually denoted $\emptyset$.  Texts differ on
  notation for the empty sequence; in 6.042, we use $\lambda$ for the
  empty sequence.
\end{itemize}

The product operation is one link between sets and sequences.  A
\term{product} of sets, $S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n$, is a
new set consisting of all sequences where the first component is drawn
from $S_1$, the second from $S_2$, and so forth.  For example, $\naturals
\times \set{a,b}$ is the set of all pairs whose first element is a
nonnegative integer and whose second element is an $a$ or a $b$:
%
\[
\naturals \times \set{a,b}
    = \set{(0,a), (0,b), (1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2, b), \dots}
\]
%
A product of $n$ copies of a set $S$ is denoted $S^n$.  For example,
$\set{0, 1}^3$ is the set of all $3$-bit sequences:
%
\[
\set{0, 1}^3 = \set{ (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1),
                     (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1) }
\]


\section{Functions}\label{funcsubsec}

A \term{function} assigns an element of
one set, called the \term{domain}, to elements of another set, called
the \term{codomain}.  The notation
\[
f: A \to B
\]
indicates that $f$ is a function with domain, $A$, and codomain, $B$.  The
familiar notation ``$f(a) = b$'' indicates that $f$ assigns the element $b
\in B$ to $a$.  Here $b$ would be called the \emph{value} of $f$ at
\emph{argument} $a$.

Functions are often defined by formulas as in:
\[
f_1(x) \eqdef \frac{1}{x^2}
\]
where $x$ is a real-valued variable, or
\[
f_2(y,z) \eqdef y\mathtt{10}yz
\]
where $y$ and $z$ range over binary strings, or
\[
f_3(x, n) \eqdef \text{ the pair } (n, x)
\]
where $n$ ranges over the nonnegative integers.

A function with a finite domain could be specified by a table that shows
the value of the function at each element of the domain.  For example, a function
$f_4(P,Q)$ where $P$ and $Q$ are propositional variables is specified by:
\[\begin{array}{|cc|c|}
\hline
P & Q & f_4(P,Q)\\
\hline \true & \true & \true\\
\hline \true & \false & \false\\
\hline \false & \true & \true\\
\hline \false & \false & \true\\
\hline
\end{array}\]
Notice that $f_4$ could also have been described by a formula: $f_4(P,Q) =
[P \QIMPLIES Q]$.

A function might also be defined by a procedure for computing its value at
any element of its domain, or by some other kind of specification.  For
example, define $f_5(y)$ to be the length of a left to right search of the
bits in the binary string $y$ until a \texttt{1} appears, so
\begin{eqnarray*}
f_5(0010) & = &  3,\\
f_5(100)  & = & 1,\\
f_5(0000) & \text{is} & \text{undefined}.
\end{eqnarray*}

The example $f_5$ also illustrates an important fact of functions, they
need not assign a value to every element in the domain.  Another example
is the real-valued function $1/x$ which is undefined when $x=0$.  So in
general, functions may be \term{partial}, meaning that there may be domain
elements for which the function is not defined.  If a function is defined
on every element of its domain, it is called a \term{total} function.

It's often useful to find the set of values a function takes when applied
to the elements in \emph{a set} of arguments.  So if $f:A \to B$, and $S$
is a subset of $A$, we define $f(S)$ to be the set of all the values that
$f$ takes when it is applied to elements of $S$.  That is,
\[
f(S) \eqdef \set{b \in B \suchthat f(s) = b \text{ for some } s
  \in S}.
\]
For example, if we let $[r,s]$ denote the interval from $r$ to $s$ on the
real line, then $f_1([1,2]) = [1/4,1]$.

For another example, let's take the ``search for a \texttt{1}''
function, $f_5$.  If we let $X$ be the set of binary words which
start with an even number of \texttt{0}'s followed by a
\texttt{1}, then $f_5(X)$ would be the odd nonnegative integers.

Applying $f$ to a set, $S$, of arguments is referred to as
\hyperdef{mapping}{pointwise}{``applying $f$ pointwise to $S$''}
\footnote{There is a picky distinction between the function $f$ which
  applies to elements of $A$ and the function which applies $f$ pointwise
  to subsets of $A$, because the domain of $f$ is $A$, while the domain of
  pointwise-$f$ is $\power(A)$.  It is usually clear from context whether
  $f$ or pointwise-$f$ is meant, so there is no harm in overloading the
  symbol $f$ in this way.}, and the set $f(S)$ is referred to as the
\term{image} of $A'$ under $f$.  The set of values that arise from
applying $f$ to all possible arguments is called the \emph{range} of $f$.
That is
\[
\range{f} \eqdef f(\domain{f}).
\]
Some authors refer to the codomain as the range of a function, but they
shouldn't.  The distinction between the range and codomain will be
important in a later section when we relate sizes of sets to properties of
functions between them. %ref to mapping lemma?
