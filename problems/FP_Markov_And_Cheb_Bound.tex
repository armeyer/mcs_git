\begin{problem}

A herd of 350 cows is stricken by an outbreak of "mad cow" disease. The disease lowers the normal body temperature of a cow, and a cow will die if its temperature goes below 90 degrees F. The disease epidemic is so intense that it lowered the average temperature of the herd to 45 degrees. Body temperatures as low as 20 degrees, but no lower, were actually found in the herd.

\bparts

\ppart State a best possible upper bound on the number of cows whose temperature is high enough to survive.

\begin{solution}
 Let $R$ be the temperature. Apply Markov's bound to $R-20$:
$$Pr\{R\geq90\}=Pr\{R-20\geq70\} \leq E[R-20]/70=(45-20)/70=5/14$$
so at most $(5/14)\cdot350=125$ cows have temperature $\geq90$ F.

\end{solution}

\item Give an example set of the temperatures that achieve your bound

\begin{solution}

Of the 350 cows, 125 have 90 F and 225 have 20F. The mean is:
$$\frac{125\cdot 90+225\cdot 20}{350}=45$$

\end{solution}
