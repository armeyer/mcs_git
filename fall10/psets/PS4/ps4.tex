\begin{problem}{15}
Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph. A {\em matching} in $G$ is a set $M \subset E$ such that no two edges in $M$ are incident on a common vertex.

Let $M_1$, $M_2$ be two matchings of $G$. Consider the new graph $G' = (V, M_1 \cup M_2)$ (i.e. on the same vertex set, whose edges consist of all the edges that appear in either $M_1$ or $M_2$). Show that $G'$ is bipartite.

{\em Helpful definition}: A {\em connected component} is a subgraph of a graph consisting of
some vertex and every node and edge that is connected to that vertex.

\solution{
\begin{proof}

Proof by induction on the number of vertices $n$:

\textbf{Induction hypothesis:}
$P(n)$ is defined to be:  Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and matchings $M_1$ and $M_2$. Let $G' = (V, M_1 \cup M_2)$. Then $G'$ is bipartite.

\textbf{Base case:} $G$ has only one vertex and so is bipartite. 
$P(1)$ holds.

\textbf{Inductive step:} We will assume $P(n)$ in order to prove $P(n+1)$.

Let $G$ be a graph with $n+1$ vertices.  We will remove a vertex $v$ from $G$ to obtain an $n$ vertex graph, $G_1$, with vertex set $V_1$. If we remove $v$ we will be in one of the following cases:


\textbf{Case 1:} $v$ is in none of the edges in $M_1$ nor $M_2$.

By our inductive hypothesis we know that since $G_1$ has $n$ vertices and $M_1$ and $M_2$ are matchings of $G_1$, then $G_1'=(V_1, M_1 \cup M_2)$ is bipartite. Since $G_1'$ is bipartite, there exists a partition of the vertices into two sets, $L$ and $R$ such that every edge is incident to a vertex in $L$ and to a vertex in $R$. We can now add $v$ to either set and obtain a bipartite representation of $G'$.

\textbf{Case 2:} $v$ is in an edge in either $M_1$ or $M_2$, we will assume, without loss of generality, that $v$ is in an edge in $M_1$.

Suppose the edge $v-x$ is in $M_1$, now remove $v-x$ from $M_1$ to obtain $M_1'$.

Now by our inductive hypothesis we know that since $G_1$ has $n$ vertices and $M_1'$ and $M_2$ are matchings of $G_1$, then $G_1'=(V_1, M_1' \cup M_2)$ is bipartite. Since $G_1'$ is bipartite, there exists a partition of the vertices into two sets, $L$ and $R$ such that every edge is incident to a vertex in $L$ and to a vertex in $R$. 

We know that the vertex $x$ is in either $L$ or $R$. We can just add vertex $v$ to the other set, along with edge $v-x$, and we obtain a valid partitioning of $L$ and $R$ for our graph $G'$. 



\textbf{Case 3:} $v$ is in both $M_1$ and $M_2$

Suppose the edge $v-x$ is in $M_1$ and $v-y$ is in $M_2$, now remove  those edges from $M_1$ and $M_2$ to obtain $M_1'$ and $M_2'$.

Now by our inductive hypothesis we know that since $G_1$ has $n$ vertices and $M_1'$ and $M_2'$ are matchings of $G_1$, then $G_1'=(V_1, M_1' \cup M_2')$ is bipartite. Since $G_1'$ is bipartite, there exists a partition of the vertices into two sets, $L$ and $R$ such that every edge is incident to a vertex in $L$ and to a vertex in $R$. 

If $x$ and $y$ in the same set, either $L$ or $R$, then we can just add $v$ to the other set, and add edges $v-x$ and $v-y$ to obtain $G'$. So our graph remains bipartite. 

If $x$ and $y$ are on different sides of $L$ and $R$, then either $x$ and $y$ are in the same connected component or they are in different connected components. If $x$ and $y$ are in different connected components, then each connected component has a corresponding set of $L$ and $R$ vertices, such that there are edges only within that component. Let's say that the first component has left and right vertices in the set $L_1$ and $R_1$, and the second component has sets $L_2$ and $R_2$, where $L=L_1 \cup L_2$ and $R=R_1 \cup R_2$. Now if we swap $L_1$ and $R_1$ -- that is we define $L=R_1 \cup L_2$ and $R=L_1 \cup R_2$ -- then our graph will remain bipartite, as there were edges only within the connected components. But after the swapping $x$ and $y$ will be in the same set, $L$ or $R$, and as before we can just add $v$ to the other set to get a bipartite graph for $G'$ as desired. 

Now we will show that it is impossible for $x$ and $y$ to be on opposite sides and in the same component. 

Suppose for a contradiction that $x$ and $y$ are in the same connected component and $x$ and $y$ are both in $L$. Then since they are in the same connected component there is a path from $x$ to $y$ say $x-v_1, v_1-v_2, \ldots, v_k-y$, where $k$ is even. Then the edges $x-v_1$ and $v_2-v_3$, $v_4-v_5, \ldots, v_k-y$ must all be in the same matching (otherwise we will have two edges incident on the same vertex in the
same matching). This is a contradiction since our original $M_1$ cannot have any edge with $x$ and $M_2$ cannot have any edge with $y$ (since a matching has only one edge incident to a vertex). So this cannot be the case and $x$ and $y$ must be on the same side.

Hence we conclude that in all cases $G'$ is bipartite.

Therefore by induction our claim holds.
\end{proof}

Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph. Recall that the {\em degree} of a vertex $v \in V$, denoted $d_v$, is the number of vertices $w$ such that there is an edge between $v$ and $w$.
\bparts
\ppart{10}
Prove that $$2|E| = \sum_{v\in V} d_v.$$
\solution{
Let $S = \{(e,v) \in E \times V: e \mbox{ is incident on } v\}$.

Count the elements in $S$ as follows
$$|S| = \sum_{e \in E} |\{v: (e,v) \in S\}| = 2 |E|$$
and also as
$$ |S| = \sum_{v \in V} |\{e: (e,v) \in S\}| = \sum_{v\in V} d_v.$$
The result follows.

Once can also prove it by induction on $|E|$. You should try to.

 At a 6.042 ice cream study session (where the ice cream is plentiful and it helps you study too) 111 students showed up. During the session, some students shook hands with each other (everybody being happy and content with the ice-cream and all). Turns out that the University of Chicago did another spectacular study here, and counted that each student shook hands with exactly 17 other students. Can you debunk this too?
\solution{ Assume that the study is accurate. Define a graph $G=(V,E)$ with students as vertices and put an edge between 2 students if they shook hands. By the previous problem, we should have $2|E| = \sum_{v} d_v = 111\cdot 17$. But the LHS is even and the RHS is odd, a contradiction.}
\ppart{5}
And on a more dull note, how many edges does $K_n$, the complete graph on $n$ vertices, have?
\solution{
Apply the first part of the problem. Notice that each vertex is joined to $n-1$ others.
$2|E| = \sum_{v}d_v = n(n-1)$. So $|E| = n(n-1)/2$.}

\begin{problem}{15}
Two graphs are isomorphic if they are the same up to a relabeling of their vertices (see Definition 5.1.3 in the book). A property of a graph is said to be \emph{preserved under isomorphism} if
whenever $G$ has that property, every graph isomorphic to $G$ also has
that property.  For example, the property of having five vertices is
preserved under isomorphism: if $G$ has five vertices then every graph
isomorphic to $G$ also has five vertices.

\bparts
\ppart{5}
Some properties of a simple graph, $G$, are described below. Which of these properties is {\em preserved under isomorphism}?

\begin{enumerate}
\item
$G$ has an even number of vertices.

\item
None of the vertices of $G$ is an even integer.

\item
$G$ has a vertex of degree 3.

\item
$G$ has exactly one vertex of degree 3.

\end{enumerate}

\solution{
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is invariant under isomorphism. There must be an one-to-one and onto
mapping between the vertices of two isomorphic graphs. Therefore, the number 
of vertices in the two graphs must be
the same. If one graph has even number of vertices, then the other must
have even number of vertices.

\item
 It is not invariant under isomorphism. We do not really care what the 
vertices are. Vertices can be any kind of mathematical objects. 
All we are interested is that whether there
exists a one-to-one and onto function $f$ mapping from vertices of one graph 
to vertices of another with the property that $a$ and $b$ are adjacent in the
first graph if and only if $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are adjacent in the  second
graph, for all $a$ and $b$ in the first graph. \\

So, for example, let $G_1$ be a graph with a single vertex, 1, and $G_2$ be
a graph with a single vertex, 2. Obviously the two graphs are isomorphic, but
$G_2$ does not have vertices which are even integers.

\item
 It is invariant under isomorphism.  

Let $G_1, G_2$ be simple graphs and $f:V_1\to V_2$ be an isomorphism
between them.  Suppose $v\in V_1$ has degree 3; we want to show that there
is a vertex of degree 3 in $V_2$.  In fact, we'll show that $f(v)$ has
degree 3.
 
Since $v$ has degree 3, there are exactly 3 vertices adjacent to $v$; say
these are $v_1,v_2,v_3$.  Since $f$ is a bijection, $f(v_1),f(v_2)$ and
$f(v_3)$ are all distinct.  Since there is an edge between $v$ and $v_i$
in $G_1$, the definition of isomrphism implies that there is an edge
between $f(v)$ and $f(v_i)$ for $i=1,2,3$, so the degree of $f(v)$ is at
least 3.
 
We now prove by contradiction that the degree of $f(v)$ is at most 3.
Suppose $f(v)$ had degree $>3$.  This means there is a vertex $w \in V_2$
which is not equal to $f(v_1), f(v_2),$ or $f(v_3)$, but is also adjacent
to $f(v)$.  Since, $f$ is a bijection, there is a vertex $v_4 \in V_1$
such that $f(v_4) = w$ and $v_4 \neq v_i$ for $i=1,2,3$.  Since $w=f(v_4)$
is adjacent to $f(v)$, the definition of isomorphism implies that $v_4$ is
adjacent to $v$, contradicting the fact the $v_1,v_2,v_3$ were exactly the
vertices adjacent to $v$.

\item
  It is invariant under isomorphism.

Prove by contradiction:  Suppose a graph $G_1$ has exactly one vertex of 
degree $3$ while another graph $G_2$ does not have exactly one vertex of 
degree 3. Suppose the two graphs are isomorphic. If $G_2$ does not have 
a vertex of degree 3, then from part (c), there is a contradiction.
If $G_2$ has more than one vertices of degree 3, then there must
be at least one vertex in $G_2$ of degree 3 which is mapped to 
a vertex of degree $\neq 3$ in $G_1$. Since two vertices of different degrees
are mapped from $G_1$ to $G_2$, using the same argument from part (c),
it reaches a contradiction. Therefore, if $G_1$ has exactly one 
vertex of degree 3, then $G_2$ must also have exactly one 
vertex of degree 3.

\ppart{10} Determine which among the four graphs pictured in the Figures 
%~\ref{fig:isog}
are isomorphic.  If two of these graphs are isomorphic, describe an
isomorphism between them.  If they are not, give a property that is
preserved under isomorphism such that one graph has the property, but the
other does not.  For at least one of the properties you choose,
\emph{prove} that it is indeed preserved under isomorphism (you only need
prove one of them).

Recall that a \term{coloring} of a simple graph is an assignment of a color
to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.  A
\term{$k$-coloring} is a coloring that uses at most $k$ colors.

\begin{falseclm*}
Let $G$ be a (simple) graph with maximum degree at most $k$.  If $G$ also
has a vertex of degree less than $k$, then $G$ is $k$-colorable.
\end{falseclm*}

\bparts \ppart{5}\label{counterexample} Give a counterexample to the False
Claim when $k=2$. 

\solution{One node by itself, and a separate triangle
($K_3$).  The graph has max degree 2, and a node of degree zero, but is not
2-colorable.}

\ppart{10} Consider the following proof of the False Claim:

\begin{proof}

Proof by induction on the number $n$ of vertices:

{\bf Induction hypothesis:}
$P(n)$ is defined to be:  Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and maximum degree a most $k$.  If $G$ also has a vertex of degree less than $k$, then $G$ is $k$-colorable.

{\bf Base case:} (n=1) $G$ has only one vertex and so is 1-colorable.  So
$P(1)$ holds.

{\bf Inductive step:}

We may assume $P(n)$.  To prove $P(n+1)$, let $G_{n+1}$ be a graph with
$n+1$ vertices and maximum degree at most $k$.  Also, suppose $G_{n+1}$
has a vertex, $v$, of degree less than $k$.  We need only prove that
$G_{n+1}$ is $k$-colorable.

To do this, first remove the vertex $v$ to produce a graph, $G_n$, with
$n$ vertices.  Removing $v$ reduces the degree of all vertices adjacent to
$v$ by 1.  So in $G_n$, each of these vertices has degree less than $k$.
Also the maximum degree of $G_n$ remains at most $k$.  So $G_n$ satisfies
the conditions of the induction hypothesis $P(n)$.  We conclude that $G_n$
is $k$-colorable.

Now a $k$-coloring of $G_n$ gives a coloring of all the vertices of
$G_{n+1}$, except for $v$.  Since $v$ has degree less than $k$, there will
be fewer than $k$ colors assigned to the nodes adjacent to $v$.  So among
the $k$ possible colors, there will be a color not used to color these
adjacent nodes, and this color can be assigned to $v$ to form a
$k$-coloring of $G_{n+1}$.
\end{proof}

Identify the exact sentence where the proof goes wrong.\\

\solution{``So $G_n$ satisfies the conditions of the
  induction hypothesis $P(n)$.''  The flaw is that if $v$ has degree 0,
  then removing $v$ will not reduce the degree of any vertex, and so there
  may not be any vertex of degree less than $k$ in $G_n$, as in the
  counterexample of part~\eqref{counterexample}.}

\begin{problem}{15} Prove or disprove the following claim: for
some $n \geq 3$ ($n$ boys and $n$ girls, for a total of $2n$ people), there exists a set of boys' and girls' preferences
such that every dating arrangement is stable.\\

\solution{
The claim is false.

\begin{proof} We will use letters to denote girls and numbers to denoted boys.

There must be some girl $A$ rated worst by at most $n-2$ boys.  The
reason is as follows.  Each boy can rate exactly one girl worst.  If
each of the $n$ girls was rated worst by at least $n-1$ boys, then
there would have to be at least $n (n-1)$ boys in all.  But this is
false when $n \geq 3$, because then $n (n-1)$ exceeds $n$, the actual
number of boys.

Suppose that this girl $A$ is paired with the boy, 1, that she rates
worst.  Since at most $n-2$ boys rate girl $A$ worst, there is some
other boy, 2, that rates a different girl, $B$, worst.  Suppose that
boy 2 is paired with girl $B$.

Now girl $A$ and boy $2$ form a rogue couple.  Girl $A$ prefers every
other boy to her date, 1.  Similarly, boy $2$ prefers every other girl
to his date $B$.  Therefore, $A$ and $2$ prefer one another to their
current dates.

Prove that this graph is 4-colorable for any $(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n)$.

Hint: First show that a line graph is 2-colorable. Note that a line graph is defined as follows: The $n$-node graph containing $n - 1$ edges in sequence is known as the line graph $L_n$.

\solution{
First we argue that any line graph is 2-colorable. Consider the line graph $L_n$ with vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3, \ldots, v_n$. Suppose we have two colors $A$ and $B$. Then color all odd numbered vertices with color $A$ and all even numbered vertices with color $B$. Since each odd vertex is adjacent only to even vertices, and vice versa, this is a valid 2-coloring.

Consider $G$. $G$ is composed of two---possibly overlapping---line graphs: one line graph contains the vertices of $G$ in order, while the other line graph of the vertices of $G$ in the order of our sequence $(s_1, \ldots, s_n)$. Pick one of these two graphs to color first using colors A and B.  This will be a temporary coloring. Now color the second line graph with colors C and D, noting that these are temporary colors as well. Now each vertex will be assigned two colors, one from the first line graph and one from the second line graph (since both line graphs contain all vertices). Define four new colors, AC, AD, BC, BD. Color the graph with AC if one temporary color is A and the other temporary color is C. Color the graph with AD if one temporary color is A and the other is D. Do the same with colors BC and BD.

We note that our original temporary colors represent adjacencies in the graph. That is we note that each vertex has at most 4 adjacent nodes (two from each line graph). If the first color is A then two of the adjacenct vertices will be colored B, and vice versa. If the second color is C, then the other two adjacenct vertices will be colored D, and vice versa. So if a graph has a specific color, such as AC, then it is adjacent only to vertices of color B and D. Since we color those vertices differently (with one of AB, BC, or BD), then our coloring does not color two adjacent vertices with the same color.

\solution{
Color all odd vertices with first color. Now color all the even vertices with a second color. Note that by problem definition odd vertices are only adjacent to even vertices and vice versa, hence this is a valid 2-coloring.
