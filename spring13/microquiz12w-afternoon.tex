\LARGE{ You roll a fair die twice.  $A$ is the event that the first
  roll is $< 5$.  $B$ is the event that the second roll is $> 4$.

1. Use a tree diagram to define a probability space modelling this
situation.  Clearly label the outcomes in $A$ and in $B$.  (A small
tree can do the job.  If you use a large one, you need only draw
enough of it to make the structure clear.)

2.  What is $\pr{A - B}$?
