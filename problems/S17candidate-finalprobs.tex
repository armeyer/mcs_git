Compute the probabilities of the following three events.\iffalse and
determine which one is most likely.\fi Assume that the dice are fair,
6-sided, and mutually independent.

\begin{problemparts}
\problempart Rolling at least one 6 when six dice are rolled.

\begin{solution}
The probability of rolling a 6 on a particular die is $1/6$.  The
probability of not rolling a 6 on a particular die is $5/6$, since
this is the complementary event.  The probability of not rolling a 6
on any of six dice is $(5/6)^6$, since the numbers rolled are mutually
independent.  The probability of rolling a 6 on some die is therefore
\[
1 - (\frac{5}{6})^6 = 0.665\ldots.
\]
\end{solution}

\problempart Rolling at least two 6's when twelve dice are rolled.

\begin{solution}
The probability of rolling two or more 6's is 1 minus the probability
of rolling zero or one 6's.  The probability of rolling zero 6's is
$(5/6)^{12}$, arguing as before.  The probablity of rolling exactly
one 6 is
\[
12 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{11}
\]
since there are 12 ways to choose the die that comes up 6, the
probability of this die coming up 6 is $\cfrac{1}{6}$, and the
probability of the remaining dice all coming up in the range 1 to 5 is
$(5/6)^{11}$.  Overall, the probability of rolling two or more sixes
is therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{12} -
        12 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{11}
                & = &   0.618\ldots.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{solution}

\problempart Rolling at least three 6's when eighteen dice are rolled.

\begin{solution}
Arguing as before, the probability of rolling at least three 6's is


\begin{eqnarray*}
       - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{18}
        - 18 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{17}
        - \binom{18}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 \cdot
                \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{16}
        & = &   0.597\ldots.
\end{eqnarray*}

\ppart
Suppose the best player always defeats everybody else, and
the second-best player always defeats everybody but the best. What
is the chance that the second-best player makes it to the final round?

\begin{solution}
In order to make it to the final round, the
second-best player has to meet
the winner in the final round and not earlier.
That happens if and only if the best
player and the second-best player start out in different brackets of
four; in other words, if the best player starts in position 1-4 of the
first round, then the second-best must start in positions 5-8, and
vice versa.

Here are two ways to determine the probability.  The first way counts
complete assignments: there are 8 ways to place the best player in the
first round, then 4 ways to place the second-best, then $6!$ ways to
place the remaining players.  Divide by the size of the sample space
($8!$, the total number of ways to assign all eight players with no
constraints) to get $4/7$.

The second way treats the second player's position as a random selection.
The best player can be placed anywhere.  Given the best player's position,
the second-best player will meet the first player in the final round
only if he is placed in 4 of the remaining 7 positions---not 4 out of 8,
because the best player is already occupying one (this is a common error
-- the positions of the players can't be treated like independent coin
flips or dice rolls, because no two players can occupy the same
position.)!  Since all placements are equally likely, there is a $4/7$
chance of this happening.
\end{solution}

\ppart Suppose the eight tennis players are equally good, that is, for
any match between two players $A$ and $B$,
\[
\prob{A \mbox{ wins}}=\prob{B \mbox{ wins}}= 1/2,
\]

What is the chance that the twins Al and Bert ever meet in a match
during the tournament?

\begin{solution}

The probability that Al and Bert will meet in the first round is $1/7$
(Al can be placed anywhere, but given Al's position, Bert has only 1
choice in 7).

Al and Bert will meet in the second round if and only if both win
their first-round matches (with probability $1/2 \cdot 1/2$) and both
are in different groups of two but the same group of four (probability
$2/7$).

They will meet in the third round if and only if both win two matches
(with probability $1/2^2 \cdot 1/2^2$) and both are in different
groups of four (probability $4/7$).

Since these events are disjoint, the probability that they meet in any
round is just the sum:
\[
\frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7}
+ \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{7} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

\TBA{NEEDS SOLUTION}
\end{staffnotes}

Let us look at a variant of the Monty Hall problem.  We have three
contestants: Alice, Bob, and Charlie, and each one is given an apple.
Two of the apples contain worms, and the third is a really great Red
Delicious.  As soon as the game starts, Monty Hall tells one of the
contestants with a worm (say, Bob) to bite into their apple.  Bob then
sees the worm and leaves.  Alice and Charlie then have to decide
whether they want to keep their own apple, or to switch apples with
the other contestant.

To both Alice and Charlie, the problem looks almost exactly like the
original Monty Hall problem.  Each of them has just seen one of the
"bad prizes" revealed, and they now know that one of the two remaining
prizes is the good one.  If they use the same logic from the original
problem, then they should both want to switch!  Does this make sense,
or is has something changed in this problem?

Alice will win if she keeps her apple.

Independently flip three fair coins (with ``fair'' meaning ``equally likely to come
up with a head or a tail").
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $H_i$ be the indicator variable for a head occurring on the $i$th flip, for $i=1,2,3$,
\item $C$ be the random variable for the number of heads flipped, $H_1+H_2+H_3$,
\item $M$ to be the indicator variable for the event that all three coins match, $[H_1=H_2=H_3]$,
\item and $S$ be the indicator variable for the event that an odd number of heads are flipped, $[C \equiv 1 \mod 2]$.
\end{itemize}

\bparts

\ppart\label{depC} Show that none of these six variables is independent of $C$.

\hint Consider the case when $C=3$.

\begin{solution}
If $C=3$, then the values of all the other variables are determined, namely $H_1=H_2=H_3=M=S=1$.  

Therefore, for all six variables $V$, $\prcond{V=1}{C=3} = 1$, but $\pr{V=1}\neq 1$. So
\[
\prcond{V=1}{C=3} \neq \pr{V=1}
\]
for all six variables, $V$, which shows that none of them is independent of $C$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Show that $M$ and $S$ are pairwise independent.

\begin{solution}
To see that $M$ and $S$ are pairwise independent, we check each of the cases.
\begin{align*}
\pr{S=0 \text{ and } M=0} & = \pr{HHT,HTH,THH}\\
    & = \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} =\pr{S=0} \cdot \pr{M = 0}\\
\pr{S=0 \text{ and } M=1} & = \pr{TTT}\\
    & = \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} =\pr{S=0} \cdot \pr{M = 1}\\
\pr{S=1 \text{ and } M=0} & = \pr{TTH,THT,HTT}\\
    & = \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} =\pr{S = 1} \cdot \pr{M = 0}\\
\pr{S=1 \text{ and } M=1} & = \pr{HHH}\\
    & = \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} =\pr{S = 1} \cdot \pr{M = 1}.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{H123S} Show that $H_1,H_2,H_3$, and $S$ are 3-wise
independent, but not mutually independent.

\begin{solution}
Since $H_1,H_2,H_3$ determine all the other variables, then by
the same kind of argument used in part~\eqref{depC}, no set of four or
more variables including these three can be mutually independent.

The variables $H_1,H_2,H_3$ are 3-wise independent by definition of
``flipping independently.''  Now consider the three variables $H_1,H_2,S$.
\begin{align*}
\lefteqn{\pr{S=a \text{ and } H_1=b \text{ and } H_2=c}}\\
  & = \pr{(b+c+H_3 \equiv a \mod 2) \text{ and } H_1=b \text{ and } H_2=c}
      & ([S=a] ::= [H_1+H_2+H_3 \equiv a \mod 2])\\
  & = \pr{H_3 = rem(a-b-c,2) \text{ and } H_1=b \text{ and }
  H_2=c}\\
  & = \pr{H_3 = rem(a-b-c,2)}\cdot \pr{H_1=b} \cdot \pr{H_2=c} &
  \text{(independence of the flips)} \\
& = (1/2)^3 \\
& = \pr{S=a} \cdot \pr{H_1=b} \cdot \pr{H_2=c} &
  \text{(since $\pr{S=a}=1/2$)}.
\end{align*}
Likewise for $S$ and any other two $H_i$'s.  So $H_1,H_2,H_3$, and $S$ are
3-wise independent because any three of them are mutually independent.
\end{solution}

\iffalse
\ppart Show that the five variables other than $C$ are pairwise independent.

\begin{solution}

Part~\eqref{H123S} already shows that any two of $H_1,H_2,H_3,$ and $S$
are pairwise independent, so we need only verify that $H_i$ and $M$ are
pairwise independent and that $S$ and $M$ are pairwise independent.

To see that $H_i$ and $M$ are pairwise independent, we just check the cases where $i = 1$ and $H_1 =1$. The other cases are symmetric.
\begin{align*}
\pr{H_1=1 \text{ and } M=0} & = \pr{HTT, HHT, HTH}\\
    & = \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} =\pr{H_1 = 1} \cdot \pr{M = 0}\\
\pr{H_1=1 \text{ and } M=1} & = \pr{HHH}\\
    & = \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} =\pr{H_1 = 1} \cdot \pr{M = 1}.
\end{align*}

To see that $S$ and $M$ are pairwise independent, we check each of the cases.
\begin{align*}
\pr{S=0 \text{ and } M=0} & = \pr{HHT,HTH,THH}\\
    & = \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} =\pr{S=0} \cdot \pr{M = 0}\\
\pr{S=0 \text{ and } M=1} & = \pr{TTT}\\
    & = \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} =\pr{S=0} \cdot \pr{M = 1}\\
\pr{S=1 \text{ and } M=0} & = \pr{TTH,THT,HTT}\\
    & = \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} =\pr{S = 1} \cdot \pr{M = 0}\\
\pr{S=1 \text{ and } M=1} & = \pr{HHH}\\
    & = \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} =\pr{S = 1} \cdot \pr{M = 1}.
\end{align*}

\end{solution}

\ppart Show that $H_1,S$ and $M$  are not mutually independent.

\begin{solution}
If $H_1=1$ and $S=0$, then $M=0$.  Hence,

\begin{align*}
\pr{H_1=1 \text{ and } S=0 \text{ and } M=0} & = \pr{H_1=1 \text{ and } S=0}\\
    & = \pr{H_1=1}\cdot \pr{S=0}  & \text{(part~\eqref{H123S})}\\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}\\
    & \textcolor{red}{\neq} \frac{1}{2} \cdot  \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4}\\
    & = \pr{H_1=1}\cdot \pr{S=0} \cdot \pr{M=0}.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\ppart Show that no set of three variables including both $M$ and $H_i$
for any $i\in \set{1,2,3}$ is 3-wise independent.

\begin{solution}

We've seen that $H_1,S$, and $M$ are not mutually independent.
  The same reasoning can be applied when substituting $H_2$ or $H_3$ for
  $H_1$.  We've also seen that none of the variables is independent of
  $C$, so $C$ cannot be one of the three variables in the set and still
  have the set be 3-wise independent.

  That leaves sets of the form $\set{M, H_i, H_j}$, $i$ and $j$ not equal
  and between 1 and 3.  If $H_i = H_j = M = 1$, then all coins are heads.

\begin{align*}
\pr{H_i=1 \text{ and } H_j = 1 \text{ and } M=1} & = \pr{H_1=1 \text{ and } H_2 = 1 \text{ and } H_3 =1}\\
    & = \pr{H_1=1}\cdot \pr{H_2 = 1} \cdot \pr{H_3 = 1}  & \text{(indep. of $H_i$'s)}\\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \cdot  \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}\\
    & \textcolor{red}{\neq} \frac{1}{2} \cdot  \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4}\\
    & = \pr{H_i=1}\cdot \pr{H_j=1} \cdot \pr{M=1}.

\begin{problem}   %ad hoc asymptotic approx formulas
In lecture we discussed the Birthday Paradox.  Namely, we found that
in a group of $m$ people with $N$ possible birthdays, if $m \ll N$,
then:
\[
\pr{\text{all $m$ birthdays are different}} \sim e^{-\frac{m(m-1)}{2N}}
\]
To find the number of people, $m$, necessary for a half chance of a
match, we set the probability to $1/2$ to get:
\[
m \sim \sqrt{(2\ln2)N} \approx 1.18\sqrt{N}
\]

For $N = 365$ days we found $m$ to be 23.

We could also run a different experiment. As we put on the board the
birthdays of the people surveyed, we could ask the class if anyone has
the same birthday. In this case, before we reached a match amongst the
surveyed people, we would already have found other people in the rest
of the class who have the same birthday as someone already
surveyed. Let's investigate why this is.

\bparts

\ppart Consider a group of $m$ people with $N$ possible birthdays
amongst a larger class of $k$ people, such that $m \leq k$. Define
$\pr{A}$ to be the probability that $m$ people all have different
birthdays \textit{and} none of the other $k-m$ people have the same
birthday as one of the $m$.

Show that, if $m \ll N$, then $\pr{A} \sim
e^{\frac{m(m-2k)}{2N}}$. (Notice that the probability of no match is
$e^{-\frac{m^2}{2N}}$ when $k$ is $m$, and it gets smaller as $k$ gets
larger.)

\hspace{0.5in} \textit{Hints:} For $m \ll N$: $\frac{N!}{(N-m)!N^m}
\sim e^{-\frac{m^2}{2N}}$, and $(1-\frac{m}{N}) \sim
e^{-\frac{m}{N}}$.

\begin{solution}

We know:
\[
\pr{A} = \frac{N(N-1)\ldots(N-m+1)\cdot(N-m)^{k-m}}{N^k}
\]

since there are $N$ choices for the first birthday, $N-1$ choices for
the second birthday, etc., for the first $m$ birthdays, and $N-m$
choices for each of the remaining $k-m$ birthdays. There are total
$N^k$ possible combinations of birthdays within the class.

\begin{align*}
\pr{A} &= \frac{N(N-1)\ldots(N-m+1)\cdot(N-m)^{k-m}}{N^k} \\
&= \frac{N!}{(N-m)!}\left(\frac{(N-m)^{k-m}}{N^k}\right) \\
&= \frac{N!}{(N-m)!N^m}\left(\frac{N-m}{N}\right)^{k-m} \\
&= \frac{N!}{(N-m)!N^m}\left(1-\frac{m}{N}\right)^{k-m} \\
&\sim e^{-\frac{m^2}{2N}} \cdot e^{-\frac{m}{N}(k-m)} & \text{(by the Hint)} \\
& = e^{\frac{m(m-2k)}{2N}}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\ppart Find the approximate number of people in the group, $m$,
necessary for a half chance of a match (your answer will be in the
form of a quadratic). Then simplify your answer to show that, as $k$
gets large (such that $\sqrt{N} \ll k$), then $m \sim
\frac{N\ln2}{k}$.

\hint $x \ll 1$: $\sqrt{1-x} \sim (1-\frac{x}{2})$.

\begin{solution}

Setting $\pr{A} = 1/2$, we get a solution for $m$:

\begin{align*}
1/2 &= e^{\frac{m(m-2k)}{2N}} \\
-2N\ln2 &= m^2 -2km  \\
0 &= m^2-2km + (2N\ln2) \\
m &= \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4(2N\ln2)}}{2}
\end{align*}

Simplifying the solution under the assumption of large $k$, we find:
\begin{align*}
m &= \frac{2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 8N\ln2}}{2} & \text{(taking the lower positive root)} \\
&= k - k\sqrt{1 - \frac{2N\ln2}{k^2}} \\
&\sim k  - k \left(1-\frac{2N\ln2}{2k^2}\right) & \text{(by the Hint)} \\
&= \frac{N\ln2}{k}
\end{align*}

\begin{solution}
There are $6!$ ways to choose the left-hand gloves.
  Since A and B have matching pairs, we know what they get (no freedom
  there). Now, the remaining 4 must get non-matching pairs. The number
  of choices is equal to the number of derangements of 4 objects (see

  \[
  4!1-\frac{1}{1!}+\frac{1}{2!}-\frac{1}{3!}+\frac{1}{4!}=9

Each of five students in 6.042 independently chooses with equal
probability a random integer from $\set{1,\dots,5}$.

\bparts

\ppart What is the expected number of people who choose the
number that gives their position in alphabetical order?

\begin{solution}
Let $X_i$~be the indicator for the event that the $i$th
  person chooses the correct position, \ie $X_i = 1$ if person~$i$
  chooses the number that gives her\slash his position in alphabetical
  order and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. The number of people choosing the
  correct number is then $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5$, which implies
  that the expected number of people choosing the correct number is
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^5 \expect{X_i} = \sum_{i=1}^5 \prob{X_i = 1}.
\]
  Since every person chooses a number in the range $\set{1,\dots,5}$
  independently with equal probability, $\prob{X_i = 1} = 1/5$.
  Therefore, the expected number of people who choose the number that
  gives their position is~$1$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Give an expression for the probability that
exactly the expected number of people (as given by your answer to
the previous part) choose their correct positions.

\begin{solution}
Let $A$~be the event that exactly one person chooses the
  right position and $A_i$ be the event that (only) person~$i$ chooses
  the right position. Then
\[
    \Pr[A]
    = \Pr[A_1 \union A_2 \union A_3 \union A_4 \union A_5]
    = \sum_{i=1}^5 \Pr[A_i]
\]
  since the~$A_i$ are disjoint. Furthermore,
\[
    \Pr[A_i] = \underbrace{\frac{1}{5}}_{\mathrm{Winner}}
    \underbrace{\biggl(\frac{4}{5}\biggr)^4}_{\mathrm{Losers}}
\]
  for every~$i$, thus $\Pr[A] = (4/5)^4$.

Now suppose the course TA randomly assigns to the five
students \emph{different} numbers in the same range $\set{1,\dots,5}$,
with all assignments equally likely.

\bparts
\ppart Now what is the expected number of people who are
assigned the number that gives their position in alphabetical order?

\begin{solution}
As in part~(a), let $X_i$ be the indicator for the event that
  person~$i$ chooses the number that gives their position in
  alphabetical order and obtain that the expected number of people
  choosing the correct number is
\[
 \sum_{i=1}^5 \expect{X_i} = 5 \prob{X_1  = 1}.
\]
The number of permutations that start with 1 is $4!$, so the
probability that $X_1 = 1$ is $4!/5! = 1/5$.  Therefore, the expected
number of people who choose the number that gives their position in
alphabetical order is $5(1/5) = 1$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Give an expression for the probability that exactly one person
is assigned their correct positions.

\begin{solution}
We need to calculate the number of permutations of five
  elements such that exactly one element is in the right position.
  There are five ways to choose the element that is in the right
  position; we have to multiply this number with the number of ways to
  permute the remaining four elements in such a way that no element is
  in the right position.

  One way to calculate the number of such
  permutations is to use a tree diagram; another is to use
  inclusion-exclusion \`a~la derangements (we did a similar
  problem in Tutorial~11).  To formalize the latter method, let $A$~be
  the set of 4-permutations such that at least one number is in the
  right place. We are interested in the complement of~$A$---the set of
  4-permutations such that no number is in the right place---this set
  contains $4! - |A|$ elements. Now we rewrite $A = A_1 \union A_2 \union
  A_3 \union A_4$, where $A_i$~is the set of permutations that have the
  $i$th element (and possibly also other elements) in the right place
  and use inclusion\slash exclusion:
  \begin{displaymath}
    |A| = \Card{A_1 \union A_2 \union A_3 \union A_4} =
    \sum_i |A_i| - \sum_{i<j} |A_i \intersect A_j|
    + \sum_{i<j<k} |A_i \intersect A_j \intersect A_k| - |A_1 \intersect A_2 \intersect A_3 \intersect A_4|.
  \end{displaymath}
  Now we note that $|A_i| = 3!$ for every~$i$ since we fix the
  position of the $i$th element and can permute the remaining elements
  arbitrarily. Similarly, $|A_i \intersect A_j| = 2!$ and $|A_i \intersect A_j
  \intersect A_k| = 1!$. This gives
\[
|A| = \Card{A_1 \union A_2 \union A_3 \union A_4} =
  \binom{4}{1} \cdot 3! - \binom{4}{2} 2! + \binom{4}{3} 1!
  - \binom{4}{4} 0! = 24 - 12 + 4 - 1 = 15.
\]
  Therefore, the number of permutations of four elements such that no
  number is in the right position is $4! - |A| = 24 - 15 = 9$ and the
  number of permutations of five elements such that exactly one
  element is in the right position is~$45$.  Since the total number of
  permutations is $5! = 120$, the sought probability is $45 / 120 = 3 /
  8$.

Suppose we construct a simple undirected graph $G$ with vertex set
$V=\set{1,2,\dots,n}$, as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
First, we color the nodes: For each $x\in V$, we flip a coin twice. 
If we get heads in both tosses, we paint $x$ blue; otherwise, we paint 
$x$ red. 
\item
Next, we draw the edges: For each unordered pair $\set{x,y}$ of
distinct vertices from $V$, we roll a die. If we get~$6$, we draw
the edge connecting $x$ and $y$; otherwise, $x$ and $y$ remain
unconnected.  
\end{itemize} 

The coin and the die are both fair; every toss and every roll occurs
independently from any other toss and any other roll. 

For a vertex $x\in V$, let $B(x)$ denote the property ``$x$ is blue'' and
$R(x)$ denote the property ``$x$ is red''. Similarly, for vertices $x,y\in
V$, let $E(x,y)$ denote the property ``there is an edge connecting $x$ and
$y$''. For example, the formula
\[
E(1,2) \QAND 
R(1)   \QAND 
\forall x\, x\neq 1 \QIMP B(x)
\]
denotes the property ``there is an edge connecting nodes $1$~and~$2$,
node~$1$ is red, and all other nodes are blue''.

Note that \emph{$E(x,x)$ is false} for every $x \in V$, because a simple
graph does not have self-loops.

What is the the probability that $G$ has

Your answer doesn't have  to be in closed form.

\begin{solution}
Fix any $k\in\set{0,\dots,n}$, and any $k$ vertices $x_1,\dots,x_k\in
V$. The probability that $x_1,\dots,x_k$ are blue, the rest of the
vertices are red and there is no edge between a blue and a red vertex
is 
\begin{equation} \label{probab-1}
(\tfrac{1}{4})^k 
(\tfrac{3}{4})^{n-k}
(\tfrac{5}{6})^{k(n-k)}.
\end{equation}
Since there are $\tbinom{n}{k}$ different ways to fix $x_1,\dots,x_k$,
there are exactly $\tbinom{n}{k}$ outcomes (graphs) supporting the
event that exactly $k$ vertices are blue, and there is no edge between
a blue and a red vertex, each with
probability~\eqref{probab-1}. Hence, the probability of this event is 
\begin{equation} \label{probab-2}
\tbinom{n}{k}
(\tfrac{1}{4})^k 
(\tfrac{3}{4})^{n-k}
(\tfrac{5}{6})^{k(n-k)}.
\end{equation}
Finally, the event that no edge connects a blue and a red vertex is
the union of the $n+1$ disjoint events that we get by varying $k$ over 
$\set{0,\dots,n}$, each of them having probability~\eqref{probab-2}. 
Hence, the coloring is consistent with probability

A Hamiltonian tour of a simple graph $G$ is a cycle that includes all
the vertices of $G$ exactly once.

\bparts

\ppart
How many Hamiltonian tours are there in the complete graph $K_n$ over
a fixed set of $n$ distiguishable vertices?

\hint
Remember that a cycle has no start or end or direction---it is simply
the circular sequence of visited nodes.  So don't overcount.

\begin{solution}
At first glance, there are $n!$ permutations of the different
vertices, but we need to take into account that cycles are the same
through rotation and through flipping---for example $ABCD$, $BCDA$ and
$ADCB$ all describe the sme cycle.  So we are overcounting by a factor
of $2n$ because there are $n$ possible rotations and $n$ flipped
rotations.  So there are
\[
\frac{n!}{2n} = \frac{(n-1)!}{2}
\]
possible cycles.  For example, the triangle $K_3$ has only one cycle,
and $K_4$ has three.
\end{solution}

\ppart
We construct a random graph $G$ over the fixed set of $n$ vertices as
follows: for each possible edge $e$ between two vertices, we include
$e$ as an edge of $G$ with probability $p$, independently of any other
possible edges.  What is the expected number of Hamiltonian tours in
$G$?

\begin{solution}
The problem reduces to finding the expected number of length-$n$
cycles in $G$.  A possible length-$n$ cycle $C$ has $n$ edges, and
since edges get added independently, the probability that $C$ is a
cycle of $G$ is $p^n$.  So letting $I_C$ be the indicator variable for
$C$ being a cycle of $G$, the number of cycles in $G$ will be the sum
over the indicators for the $(n-1)!/2$ possible cycles.  Since
$\expect{I_C} = p^n$, we conclude by linearity that the
expected number of cycles is:
\[
\frac{(n-1)!}{2} p^n.

Eight men and seven women have randomly purchased their individual
seats in the same 15-seat row of a theater.

\bparts

\ppart What is the probability that the first two seats are occupied
by people of different genders?

\examspace[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
Here's one way to do it.  There are $\binom{15}{2} = 105$
possible pairs that could occupy the first two seats, but only $8\cdot7 =
56$ of them are different-gender couples.  So the probability is $56/105 =
8/15$.

Or else by Total Probabilty
\[
\frac{7}{15}\frac{8}{14} + \frac{8}{15}\frac{7}{14} = \frac{112}{210}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the expected number of pairs of adjacent seats occupied
by people of different genders?  For example, if the sequence of men
and women in the seats is
\begin{center}
MMMWMMMMWWWWWWM,
\end{center}
then there are four different-gender couples sitting in the pairs of
adjacent seats that start at the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 14th seats,
respectively.

\examspace[1.4in]

\begin{solution}
Let the random variable S be the number of pairs of seats containing
a different-gender couple; we want to find $\expect{S}$.  We can solve
this problem by introducing an indicator random variable $S_i$, where
$S_i = 1$ if there is an different gender couple in seats $i$ and
$i+1$, and $S_i = 0$ otherwise.  So we have $S = \sum_{i=1}^{14} S_i$.

Since each seat is like any other, the probability that seats $i$ and
$i+1$ contain a couple is the same as in the first
part, $8/15$.  Thus
\[
\expect{S_i} = 1\cdot\Pr(S_i=1) + 0\cdot\Pr(S_i=0) = \frac{8}{15}.
\]
Finally, because expectation is linear,
\[
\expect{S} =  \sum_{i=1}^{14} \expect{S_i}  =  14\cdot \frac{8}{15}.
\]

Note that this approach works despite the fact that the indicator random
variables $S_i$ are not independent.  That's the beauty of linearity of
expectation!

\end{staffnotes}

Let $X,Y$ be real-valued random variables\iffalse defined on the
same sample space \fi, and let $[X=Y]$ be the event that the value of $X$
equals the value of $Y$.  Define a binary relation, $\rho$, on such random
variables by the rule that $X \rho Y$ iff $\prob{X = Y} = 1$.

The relation $\rho$ is \emph{reflexive} and
\emph{symmetric} by definition.  Only one more property is needed to prove that $\rho$
is an equivalence relation.

\bparts

\ppart State the remaining property of $\rho$ that confirms it is an
equivalence relation.

\examspace[0.4in]

\begin{solution}
 $\rho$ must be  \emph{transitive}: if $X \rho Y$ and $Y \rho
Z$ then $X \rho Z$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that $\rho$ has this property.

\examspace[3.0in]

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
Note that $X \rho Y$ iff $X(\omega) = Y(\omega)$ for every sample point, $\omega$, with
positive probability.
%, \ie such that $\pr{s}>0$.

So let $\omega$ be any sample positive with positive probability, and suppose $X
\rho Y$ and $Y \rho Z$.  Now since $X \rho Y$, we know that $X(\omega) = Y(\omega)$,
and likewise since $Y \rho Z$ also $Y(\omega) = Z(\omega)$.  Therefore $X(\omega) =
Z(\omega)$, which implies that $X \rho Z$, as required.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Alternative proof:}
\begin{proof}
We will prove
\begin{lemma*}
For any event $W$ of probability one, and any event $A$
\[
\pr{A \intersect W} = \pr{A}.
\]
\end{lemma*}

Assuming the Lemma for the moment, we prove transivity as follows: if
$X\rho Y$ and $Y \rho Z$, then the events $[X=Y]$ and $[Y=Z]$ each have
probability 1 by definition.  By the Lemma, their intersection also has
probability 1.  But this intersection in the same as the event $[X = Y =
Z]$, which is a subset of the event $[X=Z]$.  Hence,
\[
\pr{X=Z} \geq \pr{X=Y=Z} = \pr{[X=Y] \intersect [Y=Z]} = 1,
\]
so $X\rho Z$.

To prove the Lemma, note that $\pr{A \union W} \geq \pr{W} = 1$,
which implies $\pr{A \union W}=1$.  Therefore
\[
\pr{A} \geq \pr{A \intersect W} = \pr{A} + \pr{W} - \pr{A \union W} = 
\pr{A} + 1 - 1 \geq \pr{A}.
\]
\end{proof}

There are $n$ MIT students who are taking 6.042 and 6.003 this term.  To
make it easier on themselves, the professors in charge of these classes
have decided to randomly permute their class lists and then assign
students grades based on their rank in the permutation\footnote{\dots just
as many students have suspected \texttt{:-)}}.  Assume all permutations
are equally likely and that the ranking in each class is independent of
the other.

\bparts

\ppart
What is the expected number of students that have a higher rank
in 6.042 than 6.003?

\inhandout{\hint Let $X_i$ be random variable whose value is 1 if student i has higher rank
in 6.042 than 6.003 and 0 otherwise.}

\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
Let $X_i$ be random variable whose value is 1 if student i has higher rank
in 6.042 than 6.003 and 0 otherwise.  If student $i$ has rank of $r$ for
6.042 than the probability that student $i$ has higher rank on 6.042,
given that the student has rank $r$ in 6.042, is $(r-1)/n$.  The
probability student $i$ has rank $r$ in 6.042 is $1/n$.  Thus, the
probability that student $i$ has higher rank in 6.042 is
\[
\sum_{1\leq r \leq n}  \frac{1}{n} \frac{r-1}{n} = \frac{n-1}{2n}.
\]
By linearity of expectation, the expected number of students with a higher
rank on 6.042 is
\[
\expect{X} = \expect{X_1}+\expect{X_2}+ \cdots +\expect{X_n} = \frac{n-1}{2}.
\]

There is another way to solve this simple case, but it does not extend
to handle part~\eqref{khigher}.  The probability a given student ranks
the same in both schools is $1/n$, so by linearity, the expected
number of students with the same rank is $n(1/n)=1$.  Therefore the
expected number that do \emph{not} have the same rank is $n-1$.  But
students with higher rank in one class have lower rank in the other
class, so by symmetry, the expected number of higher- and lower-ranked
students in either class is the same.  This implies that the expected
number of higher-ranked students is half the expected number who do
not rank the same, namely, $(n-1)/2$.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{khigher}
What is the expected number of students that have a ranking at
least $k$ higher in 6.042 than in 6.003?

\examspace[3.0in]

\begin{solution}
This part can be done in the same way as the previous one.  Let $X_i$
be the random variable whose value is 1 if student $i$ is ranked at
least $k$ higher in 6.042 than 6.003 and 0 otherwise.  If student $i$
has rank of $r>k$ for 6.042, then the probability that student $i$ has
at least $k$ higher rank in 6.042 given student $i$ ranked $r$ in
6.042 is $(r-k)/n$.  The probability student $i$ has rank $r$ in 6.042
is $1/n$.  Thus, the probability that student $i$ has at least $k$
higher rank in 6.042 is
\[
\sum_{1\leq r\leq n} \frac{1}{n} \frac{r-k}{n} = \frac{(n-k)(n-k+1)}{2n^2}.
\]
By linearity of expectation, the expected number of students with a higher
rank on 6.042 is
\[
\expect{X}=\expect{X_1}+\expect{X_2}+...+\expect{X_n} = \frac{(n-k)(n-k+1)}{2n}.
\]
