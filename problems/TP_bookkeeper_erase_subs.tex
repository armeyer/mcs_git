\begin{problem}
The mapping from permutations of the subscripted letters
\iffalse
$\text{c}\,\text{a}_1\,\text{l}_1\,\text{l}_2\,\text{a}_2\,\text{b}\,\text{a}_3\,\text{s}\,\text{h}$
\fi
$\text{c},\text{a}_1,\text{l}_1,\text{l}_2,\text{a}_2,\text{b},\text{a}_3,\text{s},\text{h}$
  to permutations of the letters in the word ``callabash'' is
  $n$-to-one for $n=$\hfill \examrule[0.7in]

\begin{solution}
\[
3! 2!
\]
\end{solution}
