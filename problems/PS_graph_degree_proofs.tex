Prove that the average degree of a tree is less than 2.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
A tree $T$ with $v$ vertices has $v-1$ edges.  By the Handshaking 
Lemma,
\[
\sum_{x \in T} \degr{x} = 2(v-1) < 2v.
\]
Dividing both sides by $v$ proves the claim.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}


\ppart Suppose every vertex in a graph has degree at least $k$.  Explain
why the graph has a simple path of length $k$.

\hint Consider a longest simple path.

\begin{solution}
Let $P$ be the longest simple path in $G$.  Let $x$ be one
endpoint of the path $P$.  Now $x$ is adjacent to at least $k$ other
vertices.  All of these must lie on path $P$; otherwise, the path
could be extended.  Therefore, $P$ contains at least $k + 1$ vertices,
including $x$, and thus has length at least $k$.

\end{solution}
