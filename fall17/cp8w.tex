Simple Graphs: Degree \& Isomorphism

Spring17: half the teams finished in 45 min.  Asked them to work out
the 4 possible isomorphisms for 2(b), and gave a sermon about
``buildup error'' re problem 3.  Then asked for comments on midterm 3.
Most still dismissed after one hour.

For Fall17 using CP\_bipartite\_sex instead of TP\_handshake\_average.
