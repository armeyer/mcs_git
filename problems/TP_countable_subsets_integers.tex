\begin{problem}

   Prove that the set of all \emph{finite} subsets of positive
   integers is countable.  \hint Classify the subsets by the sum of
   their elements.

\begin{solution}   
   
   There are only a finite number of sets of positive integers whose
   sum is $n$: all the elements in the set are $\leq n$, and there are
   at most about $n$ of them, so $n^{n}$ a simple bound on the number
   of these sets. (There are much smaller bounds, but any one will
   do.)
   
   So just list all the elements in order of their sum, with elements
   with the same sum bordered arbitrarily.  For example, among the
   sets with sum $n$, list all the sets in order of how many elements
   they have, and among those with the same number of elements, sort
   them, and then list the sorts in dictionary order.

\end{solution}
