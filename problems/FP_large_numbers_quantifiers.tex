\begin{problem}
Let $G_1, G_2, G_3, \dots, $ be an infinite sequence of pairwise
independent random variables with the same expectation $\mu$ and the
same finite variance.  Let
\[
f(n, \epsilon) \eqdef \Prob{\, \abs{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n G_i}{n} - \mu} \leq \epsilon}.
\]
The Weak Law of Large Numbers can be expressed as a logical formula of
the form:
\[
\forall \epsilon >0\ \ \mathbf{Q}_1\ \ \mathbf{Q}_2\ \ \mathbf{Q}_3.\
       f(n,\epsilon) \geq 1 - \delta
\]
where $\mathbf{Q}_1, \mathbf{Q}_2, \mathbf{Q}_3$ is a
sequence of three quantifiers from among:
\[\begin{array}{cccc}
\forall n, & \exists n, & \forall n \geq n_0, & \exists n \geq n_0.\\
\forall n_0, & \exists n_0, & \forall n_0 \geq n, & \exists n_0 \geq n.\\
\forall \delta, & \exists \delta, & \forall \delta > 0, & \exists \delta >0.\\
\end{array}\]
Here the $n, n_0$ range over nonnegative integers, and $\delta,
\epsilon$ range over nonnegative real numbers.

Write out the proper sequence $\mathbf{Q}_1, \mathbf{Q}_2, \mathbf{Q}_3$.
