\begin{problem}
Let $f: \reals^+ \to \reals^+$ be a weakly decreasing function.  Define
\[
    S \eqdef \sum_{i = 1}^n f(i)
\]
and
\[
    I \eqdef \int_1^n f(x)\, dx.
\]
Prove that
\[
    I + f(n) \le S \le I + f(1).
\]
(Proof by very clear picture is OK.)

\begin{solution}

\begin{figure}

\subfloat[]{\graphic{Fig_G9-a}}

\subfloat[]{\graphic{Fig_G9-b}}

\subfloat[]{\graphic{Fig_G9-c}}

\caption{The area of the shaded region in~(a) is $S = \sum_{i = 1}^n
  f(i)$.  The area in the shaded regions in (b) and~(c) is $I =
  \int_1^n f(x)\,dx$.}

\label{fig:9G9}

\end{figure}

Comparing the shaded regions in Figures
\ref{fig:9G9}(a) and~\ref{fig:9G9}(b),
\begin{equation*}
    S \le I + f(1).
\end{equation*}
Similarly, comparing the shaded regions in Figures \ref{fig:9G9}(a)
and~\ref{fig:9G9}(c),
\begin{equation*}
    S \ge I + f(n).
\end{equation*}

\iffalse
Hence, if $f$~is nonincreasing,
\begin{equation*}
    I + f(n) \le S \le I + f(1).
\end{equation*}
as claimed.
\fi
