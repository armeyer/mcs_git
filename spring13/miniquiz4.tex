\begin{problem} [points = 4]
A majority of the following statements are equivalent to each other.
List all statements in this majority.  Assume that $n > 0$ and $a$ and
$b$ are integers.  \inbook{Briefly explain your reasoning.}
      
\begin{enumerate}
       
\item
 $a \equiv  b \pmod n$

%\item
 % $n \divides a\ \QOR\ n \divides b$
       
\item
 $a = b$
       
\item
 $n \divides (a - b)$
       
\item
 $\exists k \in \integers.\, a = b + nk$
       
\item
 $(a - b)$ is a multiple of $n$
 
 \item
 $\rem{a}{n} = \rem{b}{n}$
 
\item
$a \equiv  \rem{b}{n}  \pmod n$
      
\end{enumerate}
