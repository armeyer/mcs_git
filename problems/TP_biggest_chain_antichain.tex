\begin{problem}
  What is the size of the longest chain that is guaranteed to exist in any
  partially ordered set of $n$ elements?  What about the largest
  antichain?

\begin{solution}
For $n>0$, chain size is 1 in the ``discrete'' partial order in
which every two different elements are incomparable.  Antichain size is 1
if $n>0$ and the partial order is linear.
\end{solution}
