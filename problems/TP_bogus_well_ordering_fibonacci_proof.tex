\begin{problem}
The Fibonacci numbers $F(0), F(1), F(2), \dots$ are defined as follows:
\[
F(n) \eqdef \begin{cases}
  0               & \mbox{if $n = 0$},\\
  1               & \mbox{if $n = 1$},\\
  F(n-1) + F(n-2) & \mbox{if $n >1$}.
\end{cases}
\]

Exactly which sentence(s) in the following bogus proof contain
logical errors?  Explain.

\begin{falseclm*}
Every Fibonacci number is even.
\end{falseclm*}

\begin{bogusproof}
  Let all the variables $n,m,k$ mentioned below be nonnegative integer
  valued.
\begin{enumerate}

\item The proof is by the WOP.

\item Let $\text{EF}(n)$ mean that $F(n)$ is even.

\item
Let $C$ be the set of counterexamples to the assertion that
$\text{EF}(n)$ holds for all $n \in  \nngint$, namely,
\[
C \eqdef \set{n \in \nngint \suchthat  \QNOT(\text{EF}(n)) }.
\]

\item We prove by contradiction that $C$ is empty.  So assume that $C$ is
  not empty.

\item By WOP, there is a least nonnegative integer $m \in C$.

\item Then $m > 0$, since $F(0) = 0$ is an even number.

\item  Since $m$ is the minimum counterexample, $F(k)$ is even for
  all $k<m$.

\item\label{fm1fm2even} In particular, $F(m-1)$ and $F(m-2)$ are both
  even.

\item
But by the definition, $F(m)$ equals the sum
$F(m-1) + F(m-2)$ of two even numbers, and so it is also even.

\item That is, $\text{EF}(m)$ is true.

\item This contradicts the condition in the definition of $m$ that
$\QNOT(\text{EF}(m))$ holds.

\item This contradition implies that $C$ must be empty.  Hence, $F(n)$ is
  even for all $n \in \nngint$.

\end{enumerate}

\end{bogusproof}

\begin{solution}
  The error is in step~\ref{fm1fm2even}.  The mistake is in assuming
  that the defining equation $F(m) \eqdef F(m-1) + F(m-2)$ applies to $m$.
  But this equation only applies if $m \ge 2$.  All that's been
  proved previously is that $m>0$, so the proof didn't cover the case
  when $m=1$.  And of course 1 is in $C$, so no contradiction will
  come from assuming $m \in C$.

\begin{staffnotes}
Saying that step~7 contains a logical error is on the
right track.  The natural place to handle the case $F(1)$ would have
been right after line~6.  But the proof explicitly avoided the
case $m = 1$, by saying, ``suppose $m \ge 2$.''

Technically, there is no \emph{logical} error in line~7: it is simply
the beginning of a proof for the case when $m \ge 2$.  On the other
hand, it's reasonable to say that line~7 is the place where the proof
makes an \emph{organizational}, or perhaps \emph{strategic}, error
because it skips the $m = 1$ case.  This distinction between
logical errors and strategic errors which will cause a later difficulty is
a useful one to recognize.
