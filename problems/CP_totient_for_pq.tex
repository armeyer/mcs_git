\begin{problem}
Let $a$ and $b$ be relatively prime positive integers.

\bparts

\ppart\label{divbya} How many integers in the interval $\Zintvco{0}{ab}$ are divisible by
  $a$?

\begin{solution}
Every $a$th number is divisible by $a$, so there are $ab/a= b$
integers in $\Zintvco{0}{ab}$ that are divisible by $a$.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{divbyaandb} How many integers in the interval $\Zintvco{0}{ab}$ are divisible by
both $a$ and $b$? 

\begin{solution}
Only one number: since $a$ and~$b$ are relatively prime, the only
number in~$\Zintvco{0}{ ab}$ that is a multiple of both $a$ and~$b$ is 0.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{0abaorb} How many integers in the interval $\Zintvco{0}{ ab}$ are
  divisible by either $a$ or $b$?

\begin{solution}
\[
a+b -1.
\]
By part~\eqref{divbya}, the interval contains $b$ numbers that are
divisible by $a$, and, symmetrically, $a$ numbers divisible by $b$.
By part~\eqref{divbyaandb}, these two sets of numbers have only one
element in common, so the total is $a+b-1$.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{notrelpq} Now suppose $p\neq q$ are both primes.  How
many integers in the interval $\Zintvco{0}{ pq}$ are \emph{not} relatively
  prime to $pq$?  Observe that a different answer is required if $p$
  and $q$ were merely relatively prime numbers $a$ and $b$ as in
  part~\eqref{0abaorb}.
\begin{solution}
\[
p+q -1.
\]

Since $p$ and $q$ are prime, any number that is \emph{not} relatively
prime to $pq$ must a multiple of~$p$ or a multiple of~$q$.  By
part~\eqref{notrelpq}, among the $pq$ numbers in $\Zintvco{0}{pq}$, there are
  $p+q -1$ that are multiples or $p$ or $q$.

This fails for the relatively prime numbers $a \eqdef 2, b \eqdef 9$,
for example, because 3 is not relatively prime to $b$ but is not a
multiple of $b$.  In particular, there are 12 numbers in $\Zintvco{0}{2\cdot
  3^2}$ that are not relatively prime to $2\cdot 3^2$, rather than
  $a+b-1 = 10$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude that
\[
 \phi(pq) = (p - 1) (q - 1).
\]

\begin{solution}
By definition, $\phi(pq)$ is the number of integers in $\Zintvco{0}{pq}$ that
are relatively prime to $pq$, which is the same as the total number of
integers in the interval minus the number that are \emph{not}
relatively prime to $pq$.  By
part~\eqref{notrelpq}, this is
\[
pq - (p+q-1) = (p - 1) (q - 1).
\]
\end{solution}
