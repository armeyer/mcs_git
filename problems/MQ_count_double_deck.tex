\begin{problem}
  Suppose that two identical 52-card decks are mixed together.  Write a
  simple formula for the number of distinct permutations of the 104 cards.

\exambox{0.7in}{0.0in}{0.7in}

\iffalse

%long horizontal
\exambox{0.8in}{0.5in}{0.0in}

%long vertical
\exambox{0.5in}{0.8in}{0.0in}

\fi


\begin{solution}
\[
\frac{104!}{(2!)^{52}}
\]

  If the cards were all distinct, there would be $104!$ ``distinct" mixes.
  Call two distinct mixes \emph{similar} if they differ only in that the
  positions of the two distinct copies of the same card are exchanged.  So
  two distinct mixes correspond to the same double-deck mix iff they are
  similar.  Therefore, the map from distinct mixes to double-deck mixes is
  $(2!)^{52}$ to one, and the answer follows from the Division Rule.
\end{solution}
