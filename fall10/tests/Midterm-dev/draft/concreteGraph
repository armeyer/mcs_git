Had concrete graph prob on ps5:

asked:
what is graph Diameter?
what is the colorability?
draw a longest cycle
draw graph defined by ADJ matrix

so do mostly different stuff here:

should try with weighted graph, then can ask, 

* find MST
* any np-completeness stuff?  how about, find a COMPLETE subgraph (4 nodes, don't make things too ugly)
* find shortest path betw some 2 nodes
* give a WALK of length K (should be greater than longest path)
* what is least # edges we can add to make this a CONNECTED graph?
