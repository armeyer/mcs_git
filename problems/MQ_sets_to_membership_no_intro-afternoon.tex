\begin{problem}
  You've seen how certain set identities follow from corresponding
  propositional equivalences.  For example, you proved by a chain of
  iff's that
  \[
  (A-B) \union (A \intersect B) = A
  \]
  using the fact that the propositional formula $(P \QAND \bar{Q}) \QOR (P
  \QAND Q)$ is equivalent to $P$.

State a similar propositional equivalence that would justify the key
step in a proof for the following set equality organized as a chain of
iff's:
\[
\setcomp{A \intersect B \intersect C} = \setcomp{A} \union
(\setcomp{B} - \setcomp{A}) \union \setcomp{C}.
\]

(You are \emph{not} being asked to write out an iff-proof of the
equality or to write out a proof of the propositional equivalence.
Just state the equivalence.)

\begin{solution}
\[
\QNOT(P \QAND Q \QAND R) \text{ is equivalent to } \bar{P} \QOR (\QNOT(Q) \QAND \QNOT(\QNOT(A))) \QOR \bar{R}.
\]
\end{solution}
