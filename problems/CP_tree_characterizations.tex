\begin{problem}
Starting with the definition of a tree as a simple graph that is
connected and acyclic, prove that a graph is a tree iff it has a
unique path between every two vertices.

\begin{staffnotes}
Students should be told \emph{not} to look up the proof in the text
until they try this on their own.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
Theorem~\bref{th:treeprops}.\bref{treeprops:uniquepath} shows that in a tree
there are unique paths between any two vertices.

\begin{staffnotes}
Since a tree is connected, there is at least one
path between every pair of vertices.  To show paths are unique:

\textbf{first proof}: Suppose for the purposes of contradiction, that
there are two different paths between some pair of vertices.  Then
there are two distinct paths $\walkv{p} \neq \walkv{q}$ between two
vertices with minimum total length $\lnth{\walkv{p}}+
\lnth{\walkv{q}}$.  If these paths shared a vertex $w$ other than at
the start and end of the paths, then the parts of $\walkv{p}$ and
$\walkv{q}$ from start to $w$, or the parts of $\walkv{p}$ and
$\walkv{q}$ from $w$ to the end, must be distinct paths between the
same vertices with total length less than $\lnth{\walkv{p}}+
\lnth{\walkv{q}}$, contradicting the minimality of this sum.
Therefore, $\walkv{p}$ and $\walkv{q}$ are distinct paths with no
vertices in common besides their endpoints, and so
\[
\merge{\walkv{p}}{\text{reverse}(\walkv{q})}
\]
is a cycle.

\textbf{second proof}:  Beginning at $u$, let $x$ be the first
vertex where the paths diverge, and let $y$ be the next
vertex they share.  (For example, see
Figure~\ref{fig:5L}.)  Then there are two paths from $x$
to~$y$ with no common edges, which defines a cycle.
This is a contradiction, since trees are acyclic.
Therefore, there is exactly one path between every pair
of vertices.

\end{staffnotes}

Conversely, suppose we have a graph $G$ with unique paths.  Now $G$
is connected since there is a path between any two vertices.  So we
need only show that $G$ has no cycles.  But if there was a cycle in
$G$, there are two paths between any two vertices on the cycle (going
one way around the cycle or the other way around), a violation of
uniqueness.  So $G$ cannot have any cycles.
\end{solution}
