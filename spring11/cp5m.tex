\section*{Appendix:  The Pulverizer}

\noindent
Euclid's algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers relies on
repeated application of the equation: 
\[
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, \rem{a}{b})
\]
For example, we can compute the GCD of 259 and 70 as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{rclcl}
\gcd(259, 70)
    & = & \gcd(70, 49) & \quad & \text{since $\rem{259}{70} = 49$}\\
    & = & \gcd(49, 21) && \text{since $\rem{70}{49} = 21$} \\
    & = & \gcd(21, 7) && \text{since $\rem{49}{21} = 7$} \\
    & = & \gcd(7, 0) && \text{since $\rem{21}{7} = 0$} \\
    & = & 7.
\end{array}
\]
The Pulverizer goes through the same steps, but requires some extra
bookkeeping along the way: as we compute $\gcd(a, b)$, we keep track
of how to write each of the remainders (49, 21, and 7, in the example)
as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$ (this is worthwhile, because
our objective is to write the last nonzero remainder, which is the
GCD, as such a linear combination).  For our example, here is this
extra bookkeeping:
\[
\begin{array}{ccccrcl}
x & \quad & y & \quad & \rem{x}{y} & = & x - q \cdot y \\ \hline
259 && 70 && 49 & = &   259 - 3 \cdot 70 \\
70 && 49 && 21  & = &   70 - 1 \cdot 49 \\
&&&&            & = &   70 - 1 \cdot (259 - 3 \cdot 70) \\
&&&&            & = &   -1 \cdot 259 + 4 \cdot 70 \\
49 && 21 && 7   & = &   49 - 2 \cdot 21 \\
&&&&            & = &   (259 - 3 \cdot 70) -
                                2 \cdot (-1 \cdot 259 + 4 \cdot 70) \\
&&&&            & = &   \fbox{$3 \cdot 259 - 11 \cdot 70$} \\
21 && 7 && 0
\end{array}
\]
We began by initializing two variables, $x = a$ and $y = b$.  In the
first two columns above, we carried out Euclid's algorithm.  At each
step, we computed $\rem{x}{y}$, which can be written in the form $x - q
\cdot y$.  (Remember that the Division Algorithm says $x = q \cdot y +
r$, where $r$ is the remainder.  We get $r = x - q \cdot y$ by
rearranging terms.)  Then we replaced $x$ and $y$ in this equation
with equivalent linear combinations of $a$ and $b$, which we already
had computed.  After simplifying, we were left with a linear
combination of $a$ and $b$ that was equal to the remainder as desired.
The final solution is boxed.
