\begin{problem}
  The fact that that there are irrational numbers $a,b$ such that
  $a^b$ is rational was proved \inbook{in
    Problem~\bref{CP_irrational_raised_to_an_irrational}}\inhandout{earlier}
  by cases.  Unfortunately, that proof was \emph{nonconstructive}: it
  didn't reveal a specific pair $a,b$ with this property.  But in
  fact, it's easy to do this: let $a \eqdef \sqrt{2}$ and $b \eqdef
  2\log_2 3$.

  We know $a=\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, and $a^b =3$ by definition.
  Finish the proof that these values for $a,b$ work, by showing that
  $2\log_2 3$ is irrational.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose to the contrary that $2\log_2 3$ was rational.  Then $\log_2 3$
  must also be rational, say
  \[
  \textcolor{red}{\log_2 3 = m/n}
  \]
  for some integers $m,n >0$.  So $m = n\log_2 3$.  Now raising 2 to
  each side of this equation gives
\begin{equation}\label{2m2n3}
2^m = 2^{n \log_2 3} =  (2^{\log_2 3})^n = 3^n.
\end{equation}
But this is impossible, since right-hand side of~\eqref{2m2n3} is
divisible by 3 (because $n>0$), and the left-hand side is not.

So $2\log_2 3$ must be irrational.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
\end{problem}
