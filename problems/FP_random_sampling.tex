\begin{problem}

You work for the president and you want to estimate the fraction $p$
of voters in the entire nation that will prefer him in the upcoming
elections.  You do this by \idx{random sampling}.  Specifically, you
select a random voter and ask them who they are going to vote for.
You do this $n$ times, with each voter selected with uniform
probability and independently of other selections.  Finally, you use
the fraction $P$ of voters who said they will vote for the President
as an estimate for $p$.

\bparts

\ppart Our theorems about \idx{sampling} and distributions allow us to
calculate how confident we can be that the random variable $P$ takes
a value near the constant $p$.  This calculation uses some facts
about voters and the way they are chosen.
\inbook{Indicate}\inhandout{Circle} the true facts among the
following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item\label{partic-voter} Given a particular voter, the probability of
  that voter preferring the President is $p$.

\iffalse
\item Given a particular voter, the probability of that voter preferring
  the President is 1 or 0.
\fi

\item\label{voter-again-birthday} The probability that some voter is
  chosen more than once in the random sample goes to one as $n$
  increases.

\item\label{voter-again-population} The probability that some voter is
  chosen more than once in the random sample goes to zero as the population
  of voters grows.

\item\label{voter-uniform} All voters are equally likely to be
  selected as the third in the random sample of $n$ voters (assuming
  $n \geq 3$).

\item\label{voter-independence} The probability that the second voter in the random sample will
  favor the President, given that the first voter prefers the
  President, is greater than $p$.

\item\label{voter-conditional} The probability that the second voter in the random sample will
  favor the President, given that the second voter is from the same
  state as the first, may not equal $p$.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
  The preference of any particular voter is a constant: either "the
  President" or "not the President", so~\ref{partic-voter}.  is
  false.\iffalse and (2) is true\fi Item~\ref{voter-again-birthday} is
  true; in fact, the Birthday "paradox" implies the probability of
  some voter being chosen more than once rapidly approaches 1 as $n$
  approaches the square root of population size, and by the Pigeonhole
  Principle, it is certain to be 1 when $n$ exceeds the population
  size.  Item~\ref{voter-again-population} is true.
  Item~\ref{voter-uniform} holds by definition of uniform probability.
  Item~\ref{voter-independence} is false because successive voters in
  the sequence are chosen independently.  Item~\ref{voter-conditional}
  is true because, for example, the fraction of voters who prefer the
  President in the largest states may all be $< p$.
\end{solution}

\ppart
Suppose that according to your calculations, the following is true about your polling:
\[
\pr{\abs{P-p} \leq 0.04} \geq 0.95.
\]

You do the asking, you count how many said they will vote for the
President, you divide by $n$, and find the fraction is 0.53.  Among
the following, \inbook{Indicate}\inhandout{Circle} the legitimate
things you might say in a call to the President:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Mr. President, $p=0.53$!

\item Mr. President, with probability at least 95 percent,
                $p$ is within 0.04 of 0.53.

\item Mr. President, either $p$ is within 0.04 of 0.53
                or something very strange (5-in-100) has happened.

\item Mr. President, we can be 95\% confident that p is within 0.04 of
  0.53.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

  You cannot say (1): the only way to know the exact value of the constant
  $p$ is to ask all 250,000,000 voters.

  You cannot say (2) either: $p$ is a constant which can either be or not
  be within 0.04 of 0.53.  If it is, then the probability that it is is 1,
  and thus at least 0.95, and therefore (2) will be true.  If it is not,
  then the probability that it is is 0, and thus smaller than 0.95, and
  therefore (2) will be false.

  You can say (3): To see why, start with the tautology that either
  $\abs{0.53 - p} \leq 0.04$ or $\abs{0.53 - p} > 0.04$ is true.  Now
  read it as follows: Either $p$ is within 0.04 of 0.53 or it is not
  and therefore my random variable $P$ took a value from a set that is
  hit only 5 times in 100.  So, clearly, either $p$ is within 0.04 of
  0.53 or something strange has happened.

  It's probably best to say (4): it means the same thing as (3), but
  is simpler to say and will be easily understandable by anyone with
  basic knowledge of sampling theory.  And for people without such
  knowledge, (4) will make intuitive sense and be less likely to
  cause confusion than the fuller explanation in (3).
