\begin{problem}

  Find all possible amounts of postage that can be paid exactly
  using 5 and 3 cent stamps. Use induction to prove that
  your answer is correct.
    
\bparts
\ppart

  Let $S(n)$ mean that exactly $n$ cents of postage can be paid using 
  only 5 and 3 cent stamps. 
  
  Find the smallest $k$ such that the following 
  proposition is true.
  \[ 
  \forall n.\ ( n \geq k ) \QIMPLIES\ S(n).
  \]
  
\vspace{1in}
\begin{solution}
  
  To arrive with the number, we can begin by observing that the
  following postage amounts can be made by 5 and 3 cent stamps:
  
  \begin{align*}
  3 & = 3 \\
  5 & = 5 \\
  8 & = 3 + 5 \\
  9 & = 3 + 3 + 3 \\
  10 & = 5 + 5
  \end{align*}
  
  The 3 consecutive postage values $8, 9, 10$ will be our base cases 
  for the induction proof.
  
\end{solution}
  
\ppart

  Use induction to prove that your answer to the previous problem 
  part is correct. 
  
\begin{solution}

  \begin{proof}
    The following proof is by strong induction on $n$.

    \textbf{Base cases:} $S(8)$, $S(9)$ and $S(10)$ are shown to hold
    in the previous part.

    \textbf{Inductive step:} For all $n \geq 10$, we assume that $P(8)$,
    $\dots$, $P(n)$ are true in order to prove that $P(n+1)$ is true.

    By the assumption that $P(n-2)$ is true, we know that the postage value
    $n - 2$ can be paid with 3 and 5 cent stamps. By adding one 3 cent
    stamp to that postage, we will be able to pay for a postage of 
    $n - 2 + 3 = n + 1$ cents, showing that $P(n+1)$ is true. It follows
    by strong induction that $P(n)$ holds for all $n \geq 10$.
    
    We have therefore shown that all postage values $ \geq 8 $
    can be paid by 3 and 5 cent stamps.
  \end {proof}
  
  Note that we have actually seen a proof for this using WOP in the 
  \href{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/fall09/slides2m.pdf}{Well Ordering Principle lecture}.
