\begin{problem}
In a certain stable marriage problem with 4 boys and 4 girls, both of
the following matchings turn out to be stable:
\begin{itemize}

\item (Alfred, Fiona), (Billy, Emily), (Calvin, Helen), (David, Grace)
\end{itemize}
Suppose the preference rankings Alfred, Billy, Emily, and Fiona are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|c} 
Alfred:  & Helen, Grace, Fiona, Emily \\
Billy:  & Helen, Grace, Emily, Fiona\\
\\
Emily:  & David, Calvin, Alfred, Billy\\
Fiona:  & David, Calvin, Billy, Alfred
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
