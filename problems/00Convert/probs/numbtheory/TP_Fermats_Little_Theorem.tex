\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Fermat's Little Theorem


What is $\rem{24^{78}}{79}$? \hint{You should not need to do any calculation!}

\begin{solution}

1

Since 79 is prime and 24 is not a
multiple of 79, Fermat's Little Theorem is applicable, and it implies that
$24^{(79-1)}$ is congruent to 1 modulo 79.  This
means that $\rem{24^{78}}{79} = 1$.
\end{solution}
