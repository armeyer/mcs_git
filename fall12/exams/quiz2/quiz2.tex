 %   \remark{Maybe find a more interesting partial order to use instead.}

Fix positive integers $k$ and $n$ with $k \leq n$. Let 
\[ \mathcal{X} = \{ S \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \,:\, |S| \leq k \}. \]
Consider the following relation from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{X}$:
\[ R = \{ (S,T) \in \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \,:\, S \subseteq T \}. \]

\bparts
\ppart{7} Prove that $R$ is a (weak) partial order on $\mathcal{X}$.

Order the following functions from 1 through 6 so that your $i$\textsuperscript{th} choice is $\emph{big-O}$ of your $(i+1)$\textsuperscript{th} choice (so the function you mark $1$ should be smallest, and 6 largest).
%Arrange the functions $n^n$, $(\log n)^2$, $n^{1.0001}$, $(1.0001)^n$, $2^{\sqrt{\log_2n}}$, and, $n(\log n)^{1001}$ in a list so that each function is \emph{big-O} of the next-function.

\ppart{5} Identify and explain the mistake in
the ``proof'' of the following bogus claim.
\begin{falseclm*}
\begin{equation}\label{2n1}
2^n = O(1).
\end{equation}
\end{falseclm*}

\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on $n$ where the induction 
hypothesis, $P(n)$, is the assertion~\eqref{2n1}.

{\bf Base case:}  $P(0)$ holds trivially.

{\bf Inductive step:} Assume $P(n)$ to prove $P(n+1)$. So there is a constant $c >0$
such that $2^n \leq c \cdot 1$.  Therefore,
\[
2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n \leq (2c) \cdot 1,
\]
which implies that $2^{n+1} = O(1)$.  That is, $P(n+1)$ holds, which
completes the proof of the inductive step.

We conclude by induction that $2^n = O(1)$ for all $n$.  
%That is, the exponential function is bounded by a constant.

\begin{problem}{12}

In a famous scene from the movie \emph{Ocean's Eleven}, Brad Pitt's character Rusty is teaching poker to some serious beginners. 
Shane West (playing himself) accidentally finds himself with a hand consisting of three pairs, which draws the remark from Rusty, ``You can't have three pairs. You can't have 6 cards in a 5-card game.''

Let's consider the fictional game of $6$-card poker, played from a standard deck of $52$ cards of 4 suits ($\clubsuit, \diamondsuit, \heartsuit, \spadesuit$) and $13$ ranks (1-10, J, Q, K, A).

\emph{Your solutions to the following questions may be in terms of combinatorial quantities like factorials and ${n \choose k}$. However, it may help you in double-checking your answer to know that three pairs should come out to be rarer than a full house.}

\bparts
\ppart{6} How many ``three-pairs'' hands are there? This is a hand with 2 cards of one rank, 2 cards of a second (different) rank, and 2 cards of a third (different) rank, for example, $3\heartsuit\; 3\diamondsuit\;5\clubsuit\; 5\heartsuit\;  J\spadesuit\; J\heartsuit$.

\newpage

\ppart{6} How many full house hands are there? This is a hand consisting of 3 cards of one rank, 2 cards of another (different) rank, and one single card of a third (different) rank: for example, $6\heartsuit\; 6\clubsuit\; 6\diamondsuit\; Q\diamondsuit\; Q\spadesuit\; A\heartsuit$ is a full house.


\vspace{6cm}

\solution{ 

We can create a bijection for three-pairs consisting of 3 ranks and 2 suits for each rank. This comes out to ${13 \choose 3}{4 \choose 2}^3 = 61,776$.

We can create a bijection for full house consisting of 1 rank with 3 suits, a second rank with 2 suits, and a third rank of any suit. This comes out to ${13 \choose 1}{4 \choose 3}{12 \choose 1}{4 \choose 2}{11 \choose 1}{4 \choose 1} = 164,736$, which is (much) larger than 61,776.}

        How many ways are there to place $n$ rooks so that no rook is placed on any of these gray squares, and again no two rooks are in the same row or column?

%        \remark{My intention was for this to be a somewhat hard problem. Is it?}
