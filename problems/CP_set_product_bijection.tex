\begin{problem}
Let $A = \set{a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}}$ be a set of size $n$, and $B =
\set{b_0,b_1,\dots,b_{m-1}}$ a set of size $m$.  Prove that
$\card{A \times B} = mn$ by defining a simple bijection from $A \times B$ to
the nonnegative integers from $0$ to $mn-1$.

\begin{solution}
A bijection $f:A \times B \to \set{0,1,\dots,mn-1}$ can be defined by the rule
\[
f(a_k,b_j) \eqdef jn + k.
\]
\end{solution}
