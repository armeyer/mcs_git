\chapter{What is a Proof?}

%\newtheorem{method}{Method}
\newcommand{\posints}{\integers^+}

A proof is a method of establishing truth.  What constitutes a proof
differs among fields.

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Legal} truth is decided by a jury based on
allowable evidence presented at trial.

\item \emph{Authoritative} truth is specified by a trusted person or
organization.

\item \emph{Scientific} truth\footnote{Actually, only scientific
\emph{falsehood} can be demonstrated by an experiment ---when the experiment
fails to behave as predicted.  But no amount of experiment can confirm
that the \emph{next} experiment won't fail.  For this reason, scientists
rarely speak of truth, but rather of \emph{theories} that accurately
predict past, and anticipated future, experiments.} is confirmed by
experiment.

\item \emph{Probable} truth is established by statistical analysis of
sample data.

\item \emph{Philosophical} proof involves careful exposition and
  persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments.
  The best example begins with ``Cogito ergo sum,'' a Latin sentence that
  translates as ``I think, therefore I am.''  It comes from the beginning
  of a 17th century essay by the Mathematician/Philospher, Ren\'e
  Descartes, and it is one of the most famous quotes in the world: do a
  web search on the phrase and you will be flooded with hits.

  Deducing your existence from the fact that you're thinking about your
  existence is a pretty cool and persuasive-sounding first axiom.
  However, with just a few more lines of argument in this vein, Descartes
  \href{http://www.btinternet.com/~glynhughes/squashed/descartes.htm}{goes
    on} to conclude that there is an infinitely beneficent God.  Whether
  or not you believe in a beneficent God, you'll probably agree that any
  very short proof of God's existence is bound to be far-fetched.  So even
  in masterful hands, this approach is not reliable.
\end{itemize}

Mathematics also has a specific notion of ``proof.''

\begin{definition*}
A \emph{formal proof} of a \emph{proposition} is a chain of \emph{logical
deductions} leading to the proposition from a base set of \emph{axioms}.
\end{definition*}

The three key ideas in this definition are highlighted: proposition,
logical deduction, and axiom.  In the next sections, we'll discuss these
three ideas along with some basic ways of organizing proofs.

\iffalse The last section contains some examples of complete proofs.\fi

\section{Propositions}

\begin{definition*}
A {\em proposition} is a statement that is either true or false.

\end{definition*}

This definition sounds very general, but it does exclude sentences
such as, ``Wherefore art thou Romeo?'' and ``Give me an A!''.
But not all propositions are mathematical.  For example, ``Albert's wife's
name is `Irene'~'' happens to be true, and could be proved with legal
documents and testimony of their children, but it's not a mathematical
statement.

Mathematically meaningful propositions must be about well-defined
mathematical objects like numbers, sets, functions, relations, \etc, and
they must be stated using mathematically precise language.  We can
illustrate this with a few examples.

\begin{proposition}
2 + 3 = 5.
\end{proposition}
%
This proposition is true.

A {\em prime} is an integer greater than one that is not divisible by any
integer greater than 1 besides itself, for example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots.
\begin{proposition}\label{41}
For every nonnegative integer, $n$, the value of $n^2 + n + 41$ is prime.
\end{proposition}

Let's try some numerical experimentation to check this proposition.
Let $p(n) \eqdef  n^2 + n + 41$.\hyperdef{proofs}{eqdef}{
\footnote{The symbol $\eqdef$ means
 ``equal by definition.''  It's always ok to simply write ``='' instead of
 $\eqdef$, but reminding the reader that an equality holds by definition
 can be helpful.}}
We begin with $p(0) = 41$ which is prime.  $p(1) = 43$ which is prime.  $p(2) = 47$
which is prime.  $p(3)=53$ which is prime. \dots $p(20) = 461$ which is
prime.  Hmmm, starts to look like a plausible claim.  In fact we can keep
checking through $n=39$ and confirm that $p(39)=1601$ is prime.

But $p(40) = 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 41 \cdot 41$, which is not prime.  So it's
not true that the expression is prime {\em for all} nonnegative integers.
The point is that in general you can't check a claim about an infinite set
by checking a finite set of its elements, no matter how large the finite
set.

By the way, propositions like this about \emph{all} numbers or other
things are so common that there is a special notation for it.  With this notation,
Proposition~\ref{41} would be
\begin{equation}\label{pn}
\forall n \in \naturals.\; p(n) \text{ is prime}.
\end{equation}
Here the symbol $\forall$ is read ``for all''.  The symbol $\naturals$
stands for the set of {\em nonnegative integers}, namely, 0, 1, 2, 3,
\dots (ask your TA for the complete list).  The symbol ``$\in$'' is read
as ``is a member of'' or simply as ``is in''.  The period after the
$\naturals$ is just a separator between phrases.

\begin{notesproblem}
Show that no nonconstant polynomial can map all nonnegative integers into
prime numbers.  (This can be proved using elementary algebra, but it's a
little tricky.  It will be easier to show after we study modular
arithmetic later in the term.)
\end{notesproblem}


Here are two even more extreme examples:
\begin{proposition}\label{a4}
$a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4$ has no solution when $a, b, c, d$ are positive
integers.
\end{proposition}
Euler (pronounced ``oiler'') conjectured this in 1769.  But the proposition
was proven false 218 years later by Noam Elkies at a liberal arts school
up Mass Ave.  The solution he found was $a = 95800, b = 217519, c = 414560, d
= 422481$.

In logical notation, Proposition~\ref{a4} could be written,
\[
\forall a \in \posints\, \forall b \in \posints\, \forall c \in \posints\, \forall
d \in \posints.\; a^4 + b^4 + c^4 \neq d^4.
\]
Here, $\posints$ is a symbol for the positive integers.
Strings of $\forall$'s like this are usually abbreviated for easier reading:
\[
\forall a, b, c, d \in \posints.\; a^4 + b^4 + c^4 \neq d^4.
\]


\begin{proposition}
$313 (x^3 + y^3) = z^3$ has no solution when $x, y, z\in\posints$.
\end{proposition}

This proposition is also false, but the smallest counterexample has
more than 1000 digits!

\begin{proposition}
\hyperdef{map}{color}{Every map can be colored with 4 colors} so that
adjacent\footnote{Two regions are adjacent only when they share a boundary
segment of positive length.  They are not considered to be adjacent if
their boundaries meet only at a few points.} regions have different
colors.
\end{proposition}

This proposition is true and is known as the ``Four-Color Theorem''.
However, there have been many incorrect proofs, including one that stood
for 10 years in the late 19th century before the mistake was found.  An
extremely laborious proof was finally found in 1976 by mathematicians
Appel and Haken, who used a complex computer program to categorize the
four-colorable maps; the program left a couple of thousand maps
uncategorized, and these were checked by hand by Haken and his
assistants---including his 15-year-old daughter.  There was a lot of
debate about whether this was a legitimate proof: the proof was too big to
be checked without a computer, and no one could guarantee that the
computer calculated correctly, nor did anyone have the energy to recheck
the four-colorings of thousands of maps that were done by hand.  Finally,
about five years ago, a mostly intelligible proof of the Four-Color
Theorem was found, though a computer is still needed to check colorability
of several hundred special maps (see

\href{http://www.math.gatech.edu/~thomas/FC/fourcolor.html}
{\texttt{http://www.math.gatech.edu/\~{}thomas/FC/fourcolor.html}}).
\footnote{The story of the Four-Color Proof is told in a well-reviewed
  popular (non-technical) book: ``Four Colors Suffice.  How the Map
  Problem was Solved.'' \emph{Robin Wilson}.  Princeton Univ. Press, 2003,
  276pp. ISBN 0-691-11533-8.}

\begin{proposition}[Goldbach]
Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
\end{proposition}

No one knows whether this proposition is true or false.  This is the
``Goldbach Conjecture,'' which dates back to 1742.

\iffalse

For a Computer Scientist, some of the most important questions are about
program and system ``correctness'' -- whether a program or system does what
it's supposed to.  Programs are notoriously buggy, and there's a growing
community of researchers and practitioners trying to find ways to prove
program correctness.  These efforts have been successful enough in the case
of CPU chips that they are now routinely used by leading chip manufacturers
to prove chip correctness and avoid mistakes like the notorious Intel
division bug in the 1990's.

Developing mathematical methods to verify programs and systems remains an
active research area.  We'll consider some of these methods later in the
course.

\section{The Axiomatic Method}

The standard procedure for establishing truth in mathematics was invented
by Euclid, a mathematician working in Alexandria, Egypt around 300 BC.
His idea was to begin with five \textit{assumptions} about geometry, which
seemed undeniable based on direct experience.  (For example, ``There is a
straight line segment between every pair of points.)  Propositions like
these that are simply accepted as true are called \term{axioms}.

Starting from these axioms, Euclid established the truth of many
additional propositions by providing ``proofs''.  A \term{proof} is a
sequence of logical deductions from axioms and previously-proved
statements that concludes with the proposition in question.  You
probably wrote many proofs in high school geometry class, and you'll
see a lot more in this course.

There are several common terms for a proposition that has been proved.
The different terms hint at the role of the proposition within a
larger body of work.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Important propositions are called \term{theorems}.
\item A \term{lemma} is a preliminary proposition useful for proving
later propositions.
\item A \term{corollary} is a proposition that follows
in just a few logical steps from a theorem.  
\end{itemize}
%
The definitions are not precise.  In fact, sometimes a good lemma
turns out to be far more important than the theorem it was originally
used to prove.

Euclid's axiom-and-proof approach, now called the \term{axiomatic method},
is the foundation for mathematics today.  In fact, just a
handful of axioms, called the axioms Zermelo-Frankel with Choice (ZFC),
together with a few logical deduction rules, appear to be
sufficient to derive essentially all of mathematics.

\floatingtextbox{
\textboxtitle{The ZFC Axioms}

We're \textit{not} going to be working with the Axioms of Zermelo-Frankel
Set Theory with Choice (ZFC) in this course, but we thought you might like
to see them.  Essentially all of mathematics can be derived from these
axioms together with a few logical deduction rules.
%
\begin{description}

\item[Extensionality.] Two sets are equal if they have the same members.
\iffalse
In formal logical notation, this would be stated as:
\[
(\forall z.\; (z \in x \iff z \in y)) \implies x = y.
\]
\fi

\item[Pairing.] For any two sets $x$ and $y$, there is a set,
     $\set{x,y}$, with $x$ and $y$ as its only elements.

\item[Union.] The union of a collection of sets is also a set.
\iffalse
%
\[
\exists u \forall x.\; (\exists y.\; x \in y \wedge y \in z) \iff x \in u.
\]
(The symbol $\exists$ is read ``there exists''.)
\fi

\item[Infinity.]  There is an infinite set.  Specifically, there is a
  nonempty set, $x$, such that for any set $y \in x$, the set $\set{y}$ is
  also a member of $x$

\item[Subset.] Given any set, $x$, and any proposition $P(y)$, there is a
  set containing precisely those elements $y \in x$ for which $P(y)$ holds.

\item[Power Set.]  All the subsets of a set form another set.

\item[Replacement.]  The image of a set under a function is a set.
\iffalse
%
\[
\forall w \exists y \forall z (\phi(w,z) \implies z = y)
        \implies \exists y \forall z (
            z \in y \iff \exists w (w \in x \wedge \phi(w,z)))
\]
\fi

\item[Foundation.]  \iffalse
For every non-empty set, $x$, there is a set $y \in x$
  such that $x$ and $y$ have no elements in common.  (This most technical
  of the axioms aims to capture the idea that sets are built up
  successively from simpler sets.  It says that \fi
There cannot be an infinite sequence
\[
\cdots \in x_n \in \cdots \in x_1 \in x_0
\]
of sets each of which is a member of the previous one.  In particular,
this axiom prevents a set from being a member of itself.)

\item[Choice.]  We can choose one element from each set in a collection of
  nonempty sets.  More precisely, if $c$ is a set, and every element
  of $c$ is itself a set that is nonempty, then there is a ``choice''
  function, $g$, such that $g(y) \in y$ for every $y \in c$.

\iffalse
 %
\[
\exists y \forall z \forall w (
    (z \in w \wedge w \in x) \implies
    \exists v \exists u (\exists t ((u \in w \wedge w \in t) \wedge
                                       (u \in t \wedge t \in y))
    \iff u = v))
\]
\fi

\end{description}}

\subsection{Our Axioms}

The ZFC axioms are important in studying and justifying the foundations of
Mathematics, but for practical purposes, they are much too primitive.
Proving theorems in ZFC is a little like writing programs in byte code
instead of a full-fledged programming language ---by one reckoning, a
formal proof in ZFC that $2 + 2 = 4$ requires more than 20,000 steps!  So
instead of starting with ZFC, we're going to take a \textit{huge} set of
axioms as our foundation: we'll accept all familiar facts from high school
math!

This will give us a quick launch, but you may find this imprecise
specification of the axioms troubling at times.  For example, in the midst
of a proof, you may find yourself wondering, ``Must I prove this little
fact or can I take it as an axiom?''  Feel free to ask for guidance, but
really there is no absolute answer.  Just be up front about what you're
assuming, and don't try to evade homework and exam problems by declaring
everything an axiom!

\subsection{Patterns of Proof}

In principle, a proof can be \textit{any} sequence of logical
deductions from axioms and previously proved statements that concludes
with the proposition in question.  This freedom in constructing a
proof can seem overwhelming at first.  How do you even \textit{start}
a proof?

Here's the good news: many proofs follow one of a handful of standard
templates.  Each proof has it own details, of course, but these
templates at least provide you with an outline to fill in.  We'll go
through several of these standard patterns, pointing out the basic
idea and common pitfalls and giving some examples.  Many of these
templates fit together; one may give you a top-level outline while
others help you at the next level of detail.  And we'll show you
other, more sophisticated proof techniques later on.

The recipes below are very specific at times, telling you exactly
which words to write down on your piece of paper.  You're certainly
free to say things your own way instead; we're just giving you
something you \textit{could} say so that you're never at a complete
loss.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Proving an Implication}
\label{sec:prove_implies}

Propositions of the form ``If $P$, then $Q$'' are called
\term{implications}.  This implication is often rephrased as ``$P$ implies
$Q$.''

Here are some examples:
%
\begin{itemize}

\item (Quadratic Formula) If $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$ and $a \neq 0$,
then $x = \paren{- b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}} / 2a$.

\item (Goldbach's Conjecture) If $n$ is an even integer greater than
$2$, then $n$ is a sum of two primes.

\item If $0 \leq x \leq 2$, then $-x^3 + 4x + 1 > 0$.

\end{itemize}
%
There are a couple of standard methods for proving an implication.

\subsection{Method \#1}

In order to prove that $P$ implies $Q$:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write, ``Assume $P$.''
\item Show that $Q$ logically follows.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Example}

\begin{theorem}
If $0 \leq x \leq 2$, then $-x^3 + 4x + 1 > 0$.
\end{theorem}

Before we write a proof of this theorem, we have to do some
scratchwork to figure out why it is true.

The inequality certainly holds for $x = 0$; then the left side is
equal to 1 and $1 > 0$.  As $x$ grows, the $4x$ term (which is
positive) initially seems to have greater magnitude than $-x^3$ (which
is negative).  For example, when $x = 1$, we have $4x = 4$, but $-x^3
= -1$ only.  In fact, it looks like $-x^3$ doesn't begin to dominate
until $x > 2$.  So it seems the $-x^3 + 4x$ part should be nonnegative
for all $x$ between 0 and 2, which would imply that $-x^3 + 4x + 1$ is
positive.

So far, so good.  But we still have to replace all those ``seems
like'' phrases with solid, logical arguments.  We can get a better
handle on the critical $-x^3 + 4x$ part by factoring it, which is not
too hard:
%
\[
-x^3 + 4x = x (2 - x)(2 + x)
\]
%
Aha!  For $x$ between 0 and 2, all of the terms on the right side are
nonnegative.  And a product of nonnegative terms is also nonnegative.
Let's organize this blizzard of observations into a clean proof.

\begin{proof}
Assume $0 \leq x \leq 2$.  Then $x$, $2 - x$, and $2 + x$ are all
nonnegative.  Therefore, the product of these terms is also
nonnegative.  Adding 1 to this product gives a positive number, so:
%
\[
x (2 - x)(2 + x) + 1 > 0
\]
%
Multiplying out on the left side proves that
%
\[
-x^3 + 4x + 1 > 0
\]
%
as claimed.
\end{proof}

There are a couple points here that apply to all proofs:
%
\begin{itemize}

\item You'll often need to do some scratchwork while you're trying to
figure out the logical steps of a proof.  Your scratchwork can be as
disorganized as you like--- full of dead-ends, strange diagrams,
obscene words, whatever.  But keep your scratchwork separate from your
final proof, which should be clear and concise.

\item Proofs typically begin with the word ``Proof'' and end with some
sort of doohickey like $\Box$ or ``q.e.d''.  The only purpose for
these conventions is to clarify where proofs begin and end.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Method \#2 - Prove the Contrapositive}

An implication (``$P$ implies $Q$'') is logically equivalent to its
\emph{contrapositive} ``not $Q$ implies not $P$''; proving one is as good
as proving the other, and proving the contrapositive is sometimes easier
than proving the original statement.  If so, then you can proceed as
follows:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write, ``We prove the contrapositive:'' and then state the
contrapositive.
\item Proceed as in Method \#1.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Example}

\begin{theorem}
If $r$ is irrational, then $\sqrt{r}$ is also irrational.
\end{theorem}

Recall that rational numbers are equal to a ratio of integers and
irrational numbers are not.  So we must show that if $r$ is \textit{not} a
ratio of integers, then $\sqrt{r}$ is also \textit{not} a ratio of
integers.  That's pretty convoluted!  We can eliminate both \emph{not}'s
and make the proof straightforward by considering the contrapositive
instead.

\begin{proof}
We prove the contrapositive: if $\sqrt{r}$ is rational, then $r$ is
rational.

Assume that $\sqrt{r}$ is rational.  Then there exist integers $a$ and $b$
such that:
%
\[
\sqrt{r} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
%
Squaring both sides gives:
%
\[
r  = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
\]
%
Since $a^2$ and $b^2$ are integers, $r$ is also rational.
\end{proof}


\section{Proving an ``If and Only If''}
\label{sec:prove_iff}

Many mathematical theorems assert that two statements are logically
equivalent; that is, one holds if and only if the other does.  Here is an
example that has been known for several thousand years:
\begin{quote}
Two triangles have the same side lengths if and only if two
side lengths and the angle between those sides are the same.
\end{quote}

The phrase ``if and only if'' comes up so often that it is often
abbreviated ``iff''.

\subsection{Method \#1:  Prove Each Statement Implies the Other}

The statement ``$P$ iff $Q$'' is equivalent to the two statements ``$P$
implies $Q$'' and ``$Q$ implies $P$''.  So you can prove an ``iff'' by
proving \textit{two} implications:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write, ``We prove $P$ implies $Q$ and vice-versa.''
\item Write, ``First, we show $P$ implies $Q$.'' Do this by one
of the methods in Section~\ref{sec:prove_implies}.
\item Write, ``Now, we show $Q$ implies $P$.''  Again, do this by
one of the methods in Section~\ref{sec:prove_implies}.
\end{enumerate}

\iffalse

\subsection*{Example}

Two sets are defined to be equal if they contain the same elements; that
is, $X = Y$ means $z \in X$ if and only if $z \in Y$.  (This is actually
the first of the ZFC axioms.)  So set equality theorems can be stated and
proved as ``iff'' theorems.

\begin{theorem}[Distributive Law for Sets]
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets.  Then:
%
\[
A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We show $z \in A \cap (B \cup C)$ implies $z \in (A \cap B) \cup (A
\cap C)$ and vice-versa.

First, we show $z \in A \cap (B \cup C)$ implies $z \in (A \cap B)
\cup (A \cap C)$.  Assume $z \in A \cap (B \cup C)$.  Then $z$ is in
$A$ and $z$ is also in $B$ or $C$.  Thus, $z$ is in either $A \cap B$
or $A \cap C$, which implies $z \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$.

Second, we show $z \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$ implies $z \in A \cap
(B \cup C)$.  Assume $z \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$.  Then $z$ is
in both $A$ and $B$ or else $z$ is in both $A$ and $C$.  Thus, $z$ is
in $A$ and $z$ is also in $B$ or $C$.  This implies $z \in A \cap (B
\cup C)$.
\end{proof}
\fi

\subsection{Method \#2:  Construct a Chain of Iffs}
In order to prove that $P$ is true iff $Q$ is true:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write, ``We construct a chain of if-and-only-if implications.''
\item Prove $P$ is equivalent to a second statement which is
equivalent to a third statement and so forth until you reach $Q$.
\end{enumerate}
%
This method sometimes requires more ingenuity than the first, but the
result can be a short, elegant proof.

\subsection*{Example}

The \textit{standard deviation} of a sequence of values $x_1, x_2,
\dots, x_n$ is defined to be:
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{sd}
\sqrt{\frac{(x_1 - \mu)^2 + (x_2 - \mu)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - \mu)^2}{n}}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\mu$ is the \emph{mean} of the values:
%
\[
\mu \eqdef \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}
\]

\begin{theorem}
The standard deviation of a sequence of values $x_1, \dots, x_n$ is
zero iff all the values are equal to the mean.
\end{theorem}

For example, the standard deviation of test scores is zero if and only
if everyone scored exactly the class average.

\begin{proof}
We construct a chain of ``iff'' implications, starting with the
statement that the standard deviation~\eqref{sd} is zero:
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{sqrtis0}
\sqrt{\frac{(x_1 - \mu)^2 + (x_2 - \mu)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - \mu)^2}{n}} = 0.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Now since zero is the only number whose square root is zero,
equation~\eqref{sqrtis0} holds iff
\begin{eqnarray}\label{is0}
(x_1 - \mu)^2 + (x_2 - \mu)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - \mu)^2 = 0.
\end{eqnarray}
Now squares of real numbers are always nonnegative, so every term on the
left hand side of equation~\eqref{is0} is nonnegative.  This means
that~\eqref{is0} holds iff
\begin{equation}\label{every}
\text{Every term on the left hand side of~\eqref{is0} is zero.}
\end{equation}
But a term $(x_i - \mu)^2$ is zero iff $x_i=\mu$, so~\eqref{every} is true
iff
\[
\text{Every $x_i$ equals the mean.}
\]

\end{proof}

\iffalse

\begin{notesproblem}
Reformulate the proof of the Distributive Law for Sets as a chain of
if-and-only-if implications.
\end{notesproblem}
\fi

%\section{More Proof Techniques}


\hyperdef{proof}{cases}{\section{Proof by Cases}}
Breaking a complicated proof into cases and proving each case separately
is a useful, common proof strategy.  Here's an amusing example.

Let's agree that given any two people, either they have met or not.  If
every pair of people in a group has met, we'll call the group a
\term{club}.  If every pair of people in a group has not met, we'll call
it a group of \term{strangers}.

\begin{theorem*}
Every collection of 6 people includes a club of 3 people or a group of 3
strangers.
\end{theorem*}

\begin{proof}
The proof is by case analysis\footnote{Describing your approach at the
outset helps orient the reader.}.  Let $x$ denote one of the six
people.  There are two cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{3met} Among 5 other people besides $x$, at least 3 have met
  $x$.

\item \label{3notmet} Among the 5 other people, at least 3 have not met
  $x$.
\end{enumerate}

Now we have to be sure that at least one of these two cases must
hold,\footnote{Part of a case analysis argument is showing that you've
  covered all the cases.  Often this is obvious, because the two cases are
  of the form ``$P$'' and ``not $P$''.  However, the situation above is
  not stated quite so simply.} but that's easy: we've split the 5 people
into two groups, those who have shaken hands with $x$ and those who have
not, so one the groups must have at least half the people.

Namely, let $m$ be the number of the 5 other people that have met $x$; so
$5-m$ of these people have not met $x$.  Now possibility is that $m \geq
3$, in which case~\ref{3met} holds.  The other possibility is that $m <
3$, so $5-m > 5-3$, which implies that $5-m \ge 3$, which means
case~\ref{3notmet} holds.  So at least one of the cases~\ref{3met}
and~\ref{3notmet} must hold.
\fi

\textbf{Case 1:}  Suppose that at least 3 people did meet $x$.

This case splits into two subcases:
\begin{quote}

\textbf{Case 1.1:} No pair among those people met each other.  Then these
people are a group of at least 3 strangers.  So the Theorem holds in this
subcase.

\textbf{Case 1.2:} Some pair among those people have met each other.
Then that pair, together with $x$, form a club of 3 people.  So the
Theorem holds in this subcase.

\end{quote}
This implies that the Theorem holds in Case 1.

\textbf{Case 2:} Suppose that at least 3 people did not meet $x$.

This case also splits into two subcases:
\begin{quote}

\textbf{Case 2.1}: Every pair among those people met each other.  Then these
people are a club of at least 3 people.   So the Theorem holds in this subcase.

\textbf{Case 2.2:} Some pair among those people have not met each other.
Then that pair, together with $x$, form a group of at least 3 strangers.
So the Theorem holds in this subcase.

\end{quote}
This implies that the Theorem also holds in Case 2, and therefore holds in
all cases.

\hyperdef{proof}{contradiction}{\section{Proof by Contradiction}}

In a \term{proof by contradiction} or \term{indirect proof}, you show that
if a proposition were false, then some false fact would be true.  Since a
false fact can't be true, the proposition had better not be false.  That
is, the proposition really must be true.  \iffalse So proof by
contradiction would be described by the inference rule
\begin{rul*}
\Rule{\neg P \implies \false}{P}
\end{rul*}
\fi

Proof by contradiction is \textit{always} a viable approach.  However, as
the name suggests, indirect proofs can be a little convoluted.  So direct
proofs are generally preferable as a matter of clarity.

\textbf{Method}: In order to prove a proposition $P$ by contradiction:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write, ``We use proof by contradiction.''

\item Write, ``Suppose $P$ is false.''

\item Deduce something known to be false (a logical contradiction).

\item Write, ``This is a contradiction.  Therefore, $P$ must be
true.''

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Example}

Remember that a number is \textit{rational} if it is equal to a ratio
of integers.  For example, $3.5 = 7/2$ and $0.1111\dots = 1/9$ are
rational numbers.  On the other hand, we'll prove by contradiction
that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

\begin{theorem}
$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We use proof by contradiction.  Suppose the claim is false; that is,
$\sqrt{2}$ is rational.  Then we can write $\sqrt{2}$ as a fraction
$a/b$ in \textit{lowest terms}.

Squaring both sides gives $2 = a^2 / b^2$ and so $2 b^2 = a^2$.  This
implies that $a$ is even; that is, $a$ is a multiple of $2$.
Therefore, $a^2$ must be a multiple of 4.  Because of the equality $2
b^2 = a^2$, we know $2 b^2$ must also be a multiple of 4.  This
implies that $b^2$ is even and so $b$ must be even.  But since $a$ and
$b$ are both even, the fraction $a/b$ is not in lowest terms.

This is a contradiction.  Therefore, $\sqrt{2}$ must be irrational.
\end{proof}

\iffalse
\subsection{Potential Pitfall}

Often students use an indirect proof when a direct proof would be
simpler.  Such proofs aren't wrong; they just aren't excellent.  Let's
look at an example.  A function $f$ is \textit{strictly increasing} if
$f(x) > f(y)$ for all real $x$ and $y$ such that $x > y$.

\begin{theorem}
If $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions, then $f + g$ is a
strictly increasing function.
\end{theorem}

Let's first look at a simple, direct proof.

\begin{proof}
Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary real numbers such that $x > y$.  Then:
%
\begin{align*}
f(x) & > f(y) \qquad \text{(since $f$ is strictly increasing)} \\
g(x) & > g(y) \qquad \text{(since $g$ is strictly increasing)} \\
\intertext{Adding these inequalities gives:}
f(x) + g(x) & > f(y) + g(y)
\end{align*}
%
Thus, $f + g$ is strictly increasing as well.
\end{proof}

Now we \textit{could} prove the same theorem by contradiction, but
this makes the argument needlessly convoluted.

\begin{proof}
We use proof by contradiction.  Suppose that $f + g$ is not strictly
increasing.  Then there must exist real numbers $x$ and $y$ such that
$x > y$, but
%
\[
f(x) + g(x) \leq f(y) + g(y)
\]
%
This inequality can only hold if either $f(x) \leq f(y)$ or $g(x) \leq
g(y)$.  Either way, we have a contradiction because both $f$ and $g$
were defined to be strictly increasing.  Therefore, $f + g$ must
actually be strictly increasing.
\end{proof}

\section{\textit{Good} Proofs in Practice}

One purpose of a proof is to establish the truth of an assertion with
absolute certainty.  Mechanically checkable proofs of enormous length or
complexity can accomplish this.  But humanly intelligible proofs are the
only ones that help someone understand the subject.  Mathematicians
generally agree that important mathematical results can't be fully
understood until their proofs are understood.  That is why proofs are an
important part of the curriculum.

To be understandable and helpful, more is required of a proof than just
logical correctness: a good proof must also be clear.  Correctness and
clarity usually go together; a well-written proof is more likely to be a
correct proof, since mistakes are harder to hide.

In practice, the notion of proof is a moving target.  Proofs in a
professional research journal are generally unintelligible to all but a
few experts who know all the terminology and prior results used in the
proof.  Conversely, proofs in the first weeks of a beginning course like
6.042 would be regarded as tediously long-winded by a professional
mathematician.  In fact, what we accept as a good proof later in the term
will be different from what we consider good proofs in the first couple of
weeks of 6.042.  But even so, we can offer some general tips on writing
good proofs:

\begin{description}

\item[State your game plan.]  A good proof begins by explaining the
  general line of reasoning, for example, ``We use case analysis'' or ``We
  argue by contradiction.''

\item[Keep a linear flow.]  Sometimes proofs are written like mathematical
  mosaics, with juicy tidbits of independent reasoning sprinkled
  throughout.  This is not good.  The steps of an argument should follow
  one another in an intelligble order.

\item[A proof is an essay, not a calculation.]  Many students initially
  write proofs the way they compute integrals.  The result is a long
  sequence of expressions without explanation, making it very hard to
  follow.  This is bad.  A good proof usually looks like an essay with
  some equations thrown in.  Use complete sentences.

\item[Avoid excessive symbolism.]  Your reader is probably good at
understanding words, but much less skilled at reading arcane
mathematical symbols.  So use words where you reasonably can.

\item[Revise and simplify.]  Your readers will be grateful.

\item[Introduce notation thoughtfully.]  Sometimes an argument can be
greatly simplified by introducing a variable, devising a special
notation, or defining a new term.  But do this sparingly since you're
requiring the reader to remember all that new stuff.  And remember to
actually \textit{define} the meanings of new variables, terms, or
notations; don't just start using them!

\item[Structure long proofs.]  Long programs are usually broken into a
hierarchy of smaller procedures.  Long proofs are much the same.
Facts needed in your proof that are easily stated, but not readily
proved are best pulled out and proved in preliminary lemmas.  Also, if
you are repeating essentially the same argument over and over, try to
capture that argument in a general lemma, which you can cite
repeatedly instead.

\item[Be wary of the ``obvious''.]  When familiar or truly obvious facts
  are needed in a proof, it's OK to label them as such and to not prove
  them.  But remember that what's obvious to you, may not be ---and
  typically is not ---obvious to your reader.

  Most especially, don't use phrases like ``clearly'' or ``obviously'' in
  an attempt to bully the reader into accepting something you're having
  trouble proving.  Also, go on the alert whenever you see one of these
  phrases in someone else's proof.

\item[Finish.]  At some point in a proof, you'll have established all the
essential facts you need.  Resist the temptation to quit and leave the
reader to draw the ``obvious'' conclusion.  Instead, tie everything
together yourself and explain why the original claim follows.

\end{description}

The analogy between good proofs and good programs extends beyond
structure.  The same rigorous thinking needed for proofs is essential in
the design of critical computer systems.  When algorithms and protocols
only ``mostly work'' due to reliance on hand-waving arguments, the results
can range from problematic to catastrophic.  An early example was the
Therac 25, a machine that provided radiation therapy to cancer victims,
but occasionally killed them with massive overdoses due to a software race
condition.  A more recent (August 2004) example involved a single faulty
command to a computer system used by United and American Airlines that
grounded the entire fleet of both companies--- and all their passengers!

It is a certainty that we'll all one day be at the mercy of critical
computer systems designed by you and your classmates.  So we really
hope that you'll develop the ability to formulate rock-solid logical
arguments that a system actually does what you think it does!
