\begin{problem}
A license plate consists of either:

\begin{itemize}

\item 3 letters followed by 3 digits (standard plate)

\item 5 letters (vanity plate)

\item 2 characters---letters or numbers (big shot plate)


\end{itemize}

Let $L$ be the set of all possible license plates.

\bparts

\ppart Express $L$ in terms of
%
\begin{align*}
{\cal A} & = \set{ A, B, C, \dots, Z} \\
{\cal D} & = \set{ 0, 1, 2, \dots, 9} \\
\end{align*}
%
using unions ($\union$) and set products ($\times$).

\begin{solution}
\[
L = (A^3 \times D^3) \union A^5 \union (A\union D)^2.
\]

\end{solution}

\ppart Compute $\card{L}$, the number of different license plates,
using the sum and product rules.

\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
\card{L}
  & = \Card{(A^3 \times D^3) \union A^5 \union (A\union D)^2} \\
  & = \Card{(A^3 \times D^3)} + \card{A^5} + \card{(A\union D)^2}  &  \text{Sum Rule} \\
    & = \card{A}^3 \cdot \card{D}^3 + \card{A}^5 + \card{A\union D}^2 & \text{Product Rule} \\
    & = \card{A}^3 \cdot \card{D}^3 + \card{A}^5 + (\card{A}+\card{D})^2 & \text{Sum Rule} \\
    & = 26^3 \cdot 10^3 + 26^5 + 36^2 = 29458672
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
