\begin{problem}
There is a robot that steps between integer positions in 3-dimensional
space.  Each step of the robot increments one coordinate and leaves
the other two unchanged.  How many paths can the robot follow going
from the origin $(1,1,1)$ to $(3,4,5)$?

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{9}{2,3,4}
\]

There is an obvious bijection between such paths and sequences of
$3-1=2$ x's, $4-1=3$ y's, and $5-1=4$ z's corresponding to which
coordinate gets incremented at each step.
\end{solution}
