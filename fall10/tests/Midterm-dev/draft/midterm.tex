\begin{problem}{20}
Define a number
$S_p = 1^p + 2^p +3^p + \ldots (p-1)^p.$
Use Fermat's theorem to show that if $p$ is an odd prime, then $p|S_p$.

\solution{
\begin{eqnarray*}
S_p &\equiv& 1^p + 2^p + \ldots (p-1)^p\\
& \equiv& 1\cdot1^{p-1} + 2\cdot2^{p-1} + \ldots + (p-1)\cdot (p-1)^{p-1}\\
& \equiv& 1\cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + \ldots + (p-1) \cdot 1\\
& \equiv& 1+2+\ldots + (p-1)\\
& \equiv & \frac{(p-1)p}2 \pmod p
\end{eqnarray*}
$p$ is odd, so $p-1$ is even, which means $\frac{p-1}2$ is some integer $k$. Therefore
\[S_p \equiv kp \equiv 0 \pmod p,\]
so $p|S_p$.
}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{20}
Suppose $S(n)$ is a predicate on natural numbers, $n$, and suppose
\begin{equation}\label{Sk2}
\forall k \in \mathbb{N} \; S(k) \implies S(k+2).
\end{equation}
If~(\ref{Sk2}) holds, some of the assertions below must \emph{always}
(\textbf{A}) hold, some \emph{can} (\textbf{C}) hold but not always,
and some can \emph{never} (\textbf{N}) hold.  Indicate which case
applies for each of the assertions by \textbf{circling} the correct
letter.

\bparts

\ppart{2}  \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} 
$\forall n \ge 0\; S(n)$ 
\solution{\textbf{C}.
The assertion means that $S$ is always true.  So $S(k+2)$ is always true, and
therefore $S(k) \implies S(k+2)$ is always true.  So this case is possible.
But~\ref{Sk2} also holds when $S$ is always false, so the asertion does not
always hold when \ref{Sk2} does}

\ppart{2} \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} $\neg{S(0)}
\land \forall n \ge 1\; S(n)$ 
\solution{\textbf{C}.
This time $S$ is false at 0, but true everywhere else.  So $S(k) \implies
S(k+2)$ still always holds because $S(k+2)$ is still always true.  So this
assertion can hold, but not always, since~(\ref{Sk2}) can hold when $S(0)$ is
true.}

\ppart{2}  \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} 
$\forall n \ge 0\; \neg{S(n)}$
\solution{\textbf{C.}
Now $S$ is always false.  So $S(k) \implies S(k+2)$ is always true because
$S(k)$ is false.  So this case is possible, but again does not always hold.}

\ppart{2}  \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} 
$(\forall n \le 100\; S(n)) \land (\forall n > 100\; \neg{S(n)})$ 
\solution{\textbf{N}.
In this case, $S$ is true for $n$ up to 100 and false from 101 on.  So $S(99)$
is true, but $S(101)$ is false.  That means that $S(k) \not \implies S(k+2)$
for $k = 99$.  This case is impossible.}

\ppart{2} \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} $(\forall n
\le 100\; \neg{S(n)}) \land (\forall n > 100\; S(n))$ 
\solution{\textbf{C}.
In this case, $S$ is false for $n$ up to 100 and true from 101 on.  So $S(k)
\implies S(k+2)$ for $k \le 100$ because $S(k)$ is false, and $S(k) \implies
S(k+2)$ for $k \ge 99$ because $S(k+2)$ is true.  So this case is possible, but
again does not always hold}

\ppart{2}  \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} 
$S(0) \implies \forall n\ S(n+2)$ 
\solution{\textbf{C}.
If $S(n)$ is always true this assertion holds.  So this case is possible.  If
$S(n)$ is true only for even $n$~(\ref{Sk2}) still holds, but $S(1+2)$ is
false.  So this case does not always hold.}

\ppart{2}  \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} 
$S(1) \implies \forall n\ S(2n+1)$
\solution{\textbf{A}.
This assertion says that if $S(1)$ holds, then $S(n)$ holds for all odd $n$.
This case is always true.}

\ppart{2}  \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} 
$[\exists n\, S(2n)] \implies \forall n \ S(2n+2)$
\solution{\textbf{C}.
If $S(n)$ is always true, this assertion holds.  So this case is possible.  If
$S(n)$ is true only for even $n$ greater than 4,~(\ref{Sk2}) holds, but this
assertion is false. So this case does not always hold.}

\ppart{2}  \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} 
$\exists n\, \exists m > n\, [S(2n) \land \neg{S(2m)}]$
\solution{\textbf{N}.
This assertion says that $S(n)$ holds for some even number ($2n$) but not for
some other larger even number ($2m$).  However, if $S(2n)$ holds, we can
apply~(\ref{Sk2}) $n-m$ times to conclude $S(2m)$ also holds.  This case is
impossible.}

\ppart{2}  \hspace{.2in} {\bf A C N \hspace{.2in}} 
$[\exists n\, S(n)] \implies \forall n\, \exists m> n\, S(m)$
\solution{\textbf{A}.
This assertion says that if $S(n)$ holds for some $n$, then for every number,
there is a larger number $m$ for which $S(m)$ also holds.  Since~(\ref{Sk2})
implies that if there is one $n$ for which $S(n)$ holds, there are an infinite,
increasing chain of $k$s for which $S(k)$ holds, this case is always true.}

% Strong Induction

Let $G_0=1$, $G_1=2$, $G_2=4$, and define
\begin{equation}\label{Pn}
G_n =  G_{n-1} +2G_{n-2} + G_{n-3}
\end{equation}
for $n \geq 3$.  Show by induction that $G_n\leq \paren{3}^n$ for all $n \geq
0$.

\solution{

The proof is by strong induction with hypothesis $P(n) := G_n\leq \paren{3}^n$.

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Base Cases}

\textbf{$n=0$:} $G_0 = 1 = \paren{3}^0$.

\textbf{$n=1$:} $G_1 = 2 < 3 = \paren{3}^1$.

\textbf{$n=2$:} $G_2 =f 4 < 9 = \paren{3}^2$.

\textbf{Inductive Step}:
Assume $n \geq 2$ and $P(k)$ for all $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$.
\begin{align*}
G_{n+1}
& = G_n +2G_{n-1} + G_{n-2} & \text{by~\eqref{Pn}}\\
& \leq (3)^n + 2(3)^{n-1} + (3)^{n-2} & \text{by induction hypothesis}\\
& = (3)^{n-2} [(3)^2 + 2(3) + 1]\\
& = (3)^{n-2} [(3 + 1)^2]\\
& = (3)^{n-2} (4)^2\\
& = (3)^{n-2} (16)\\
& < (3)^{n-2} (27)\\
& = (3)^{n-2} (3)^3\\
& = (3)^{n+1}

\begin{problem}{0}
In a stable matching between $n$ boys and girls produced by the Mating
Ritual, call a person \term*{lucky} if they are matched up with one of
their $\ceil{n/2}$ top choices.  We will prove:
\begin{theorem*}%\label{luckyperson}
There must be at least one lucky person.
\end{theorem*}

To prove this, define the following derived variables for the Mating Ritual:
\begin{description}
\item $r(B) = j$, when the boy $B$ is courting the $j$th girl
on his list.

\item $r(G)$ is the number of boys that girl $G$ has rejected.
\end{description}

\begin{problemparts}

\ppart{0} \label{Ssame}
Let
\begin{equation}\label{Seqsumb}
S \eqdef \sum_{B \in \boys} r(B) - \sum_{G \in \girls} r(G).
\end{equation}
Show that $S$ remains the same from one day to the next in the Mating
Ritual.

\solution{
Suppose the Mating Ritual is under way.  If the girl $G$ has $m>1$
suitors then she will reject $m-1$ of them, so $r(G)$ will increase by
$m-1$.  But $r(B)$ increases by 1 for each of these rejected suitors,
$B$, so the right hand side of~\eqref{Seqsumb} will be the same
tomorrow.
}

\ppart{0} Prove the Theorem above.                        %~\ref{luckyperson}
(You may assume for simplicity that $n$ is even.)

\hint A girl is sure to be lucky if she has rejected half the boys.

\solution{
Note that on the first morning, the $n$ boys are courting their first
choice girl and the girls haven't rejected anyone yet.  So $S=n$.
By part~\eqref{Ssame}, $S$ remains equal to $n$ every day.

Now suppose to the contrary that no person is lucky.  Since boy $B$ is, by
definition, lucky iff $r(B) \leq \ceil{n/2}$, we have
\[
r(B) \geq \ceil{\frac{n}{2}} + 1
\]
for all boys, $B$.

Now the rank of a girl's suitor will be higher than the ranks of any she
has rejected, so she will certainly be lucky if she has rejected at least
$\ceil{n/2}$ suitors, so
\[
r(G)  \leq \ceil{\frac{n}{2}} - 1,
\]
for all girls, $G$.

It follows that $2n \leq \sum_{B \in \boys} r(B) - \sum_{G \in \girls}
r(G) = S$, contradicting the fact that $S=n$.
