\begin{problem}
We want a stable matching between $n$ boys and $n$ girls for a positive integer $n$.

\bparts

\ppart Explain how to define preference rankings for the boys and the
girls that allow only \emph{one} possible stable matching.  Briefly
justify your answer.

\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
Let the boys all have different girls as first choices.  Let each
girl's first choice be the boy who ranks her first.  All other
rankings can be assigned arbitrarily.

Since the boys' first choices differ, it is possible to match them all
with their first choices.  Such a match is always stable.  Also, if
Bob and Alice rank each other first, then they would be a rogue couple
in any set of marriages where they were not married.  So this matching
of first choices to each other is the only possible stable matching.
\end{solution}

\ppart Mark each of the following predicates about the Stable Marriage
Ritual \textbf{P} if it is a \textbf{P}reserved Invariant, \textbf{N}
if it is \textbf{n}ot, and ``\textbf{U}'' if you are very unsure.
``Bob's list'' refers to the list of the women he has not crossed off.
