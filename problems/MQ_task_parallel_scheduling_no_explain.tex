\begin{problem}
The following DAG describes the prerequisites among tasks $\set{1, \dots, 9}$.

\bparts

\ppart If each task takes \textbf{one hour} to complete, what is the minimum
parallel time to complete all the tasks?

\exambox{0.7in}{0.4in}{0in}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{5}.  This is the size of the maximum chain.
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the minimum parallel time if no more than two tasks can
be completed in parallel?

\begin{solution}
\textbf{6}.  Any schedule must start with \textbf{9} and then
\textbf{8}.  This leaves 7 tasks which will require at least
$\ceil{7/2} = 4$ more time units, so a minimum 2-processor schedule
must take parallel time 6.  It is not hard to find a 2-processor
schedule that finishes in 6 time units.
\end{solution}
