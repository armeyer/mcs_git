%% type: short-answer
%% title: Above Average Number of Fingers

There's a common wisecrack that says 90\% of drivers consider themselves
above average.  This may sound absurd, but maybe
not: after all, the vast majority of people have an above average
number of fingers. 

\begin{enumerate}
    
\item
Most people have a super secret extra bonus finger of which they are unaware.
    
\item
A pedantic minority don't count their thumbs as fingers, while the
majority of people do.
    
\item
Polydactylism is rarer than amputation.
    
\item
When you add up the total number of fingers among the world's
population and then divide by the size of the population, you get a
number less than ten.

% <!--
% \item
% Some people have webbed fingers which are considered a  ``finger unit. ``
% -->
    
\item
This follows from Markov's Theorem, since no one has a negative number
of fingers.
    
\item
There are many more missing fingers than extra fingers on the hands of the world's population.
    
\item
There are a few more missing fingers than extra ones on the hands of the world's population.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

6, 7.


1: We don't think so, and even if they had this would not explain the claim.

2: The eccentric opinions of pedants don't matter, since they won't
affect the way we count fingers.

3: This says that there are more
people with fewer than ten fingers than there are people with greater than
ten fingers, which seems like a plausible explanation. However, this statement is not quite strong enough, since even with
slightly more \emph{people} missing fingers than \emph{people}
having extra fingers, the average number of fingers could be more than ten
if amputees were usually missing only one finger (which could be true),
while polydactyls usually had at least two extra
fingers (which is true). What's needed is the stronger statement that the total number of extra fingers in the world's population is fewer than the total number of missing fingers.  One reason this holds is that no one ever has more
than four extra fingers, and people with extra fingers are rarer than
people missing a hand.

4: This statement means that the average number of fingers is less
than ten, which is just a restatement of the claim using the obvious
fact that the vast majority of people have the usual ten fingers.  But
restating the claim does not explain why it is true.

% <!--
% : 5 could be part of an explanation for this claim if you assume that
% this phenomenon plus amputations outnumbers extra fingers from birth.
% -->

5: Markov's Theorem has no apparent relevance to the claim.  Markov's
Theorem simply states that the fraction of people who make up the
majority, multiplied by the above average number of fingers, namely
10, cannot be greater than the average.  So if 99 percent of the world
has 10 fingers, Markov's Theorem implies that the average number of
fingers is at least 9.9, which says nothing about how the average
compares to 10.

6 and 7: As long as the total number of missing fingers in the
population is larger than the total number of extra ones--it
doesn't matter how much larger--the average number of fingers will
be less than ten.
