\begin{problem} 
Answer the following questions about the powerset,
$\power(\set{1,2,3,4})$, partially ordered by the strict subset relation
$\subset$.

\begin{staffnotes}
parts a,b,c,d worth 3,4,4,5 points

\ppart Prove that $\sqsubseteq$ is a partial order on $B^4$.

\examspace[2.0in]
\fi

\ppart Give an example of a maximum length chain.

\examspace[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\emptyset, \set{1}, \set{1,2}, \set{1,2,3}, \set{1,2,3,4}.
\]

\end{solution}
\ppart Give an example of an antchain of size 6.

\examspace[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\set{1,2},\set{2,3},\set{3,4},\set{1,3},\set{2,4},\set{1,4}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Describe an example of a topological sort of $\power(\set{1,2,3,4})$.

\examspace[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
The empty set, followed by the four 1-element sets in any order,
followed by the six 2-element sets in any order, followed by the
four 3-element sets in any order followed by $\set{1,2,3,4}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Suppose the partial order describes scheduling constraints on
16 tasks.  That is, if
\[
A \subset B \subseteq \set{1,2,3,4},
\]
then $A$ has to be completed before $B$ starts.\footnote{As usual, we
  assume each task requires one time unit to complete.}  What is the
length of a minimum time \textbf{3}-processor schedule?

\exambox{0.5in}{0.5in}{0.0in}

\inbook{Prove it.}

\examspace[0.4in]

\begin{solution}
\textbf{7}.  For example, a length-7 3-processor schedule is:
\begin{align*}
\emptyset\\
1,\ 2,\ 3\\
4,\ 12,\ 23\\
34,\ 14,\ 24\\
13,\ 124,\ 234\\
123,\ 134\\
1234.
\end{align*}
Moreover, no shorter schedule is possible: there is a unique minimum
task $\emptyset$ which must come first and a unique maximum task,
$\set{1,2,3,4}$, which must come last; this leaves 14 tasks which
require at least $\ceil{14/3} = 5$ more parallel steps.
\end{solution}
