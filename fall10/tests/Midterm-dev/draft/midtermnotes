Oscar will take care of problems [formerly known as] 3 and 8. [sorry, hopefully you know which ones these refer to Oscar]

Nick todo:
make a concrete graph prob; identify properties; draw MST, etc.
make a t.t. problem; either "are these 2 exprs equal?" or even just, "translate this into truth table"


stuff we might want: 

induction problem on graphs

graph questions: tournament, posets.

number thry graph probs; e.g. connect numbers which are congruent to 3 mod 7?

problem on asymptotics
