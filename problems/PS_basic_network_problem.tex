\begin{problem} Consider the following communication network:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\includegraphics[height=2.0in]{figures/MQ_oct31_network}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bparts

\ppart What is the max congestion? \hfill \brule{0.5in}

\solution{The congestion of the network is at least 3,
  because every path must contain the central switches when $\pi(i) = 2 -
  i$.  The congestion is at most 3, because there are only 3 simple paths
  in total.}

\ppart Give an input/output permutation, $\pi_0$, that forces maximum
  congestion:

\hfill $\pi_0(0) =$ \brule{0.4in}  \qquad $\pi_0(1) =$ \brule{0.4in}
\qquad $\pi_0(2) =$ \brule{0.4in}

\solution{The permutation $\pi_0$ is the same as the one specified in
  part (a)---$\pi_0(i) = 2-i$.  All three paths contain the central
  switch. }

\ppart\label{minpi} Give an input/output permutation, $\pi_1$, that
allows \emph{minimum} congestion:

\hfill $\pi_1(0) =$ \brule{0.4in}  \qquad $\pi_1(1) =$ \brule{0.4in}
\qquad $\pi_1(2) =$ \brule{0.4in}

\solution{The permutation is $\pi_1(i) = i$---each switch has only
  one path going through it, so the congestion is $1$. }


\ppart What is the latency for the permutation $\pi_1$? (If you could not find $\pi_1$, just choose a permutation and find its latency.)
\hfill\brule{0.5in}

\solution{\textbf{3}.  This is the latency of
  the (unique) shortest path routing for the permutation in
  part~\eqref{minpi}.  No smaller latency is possible since the minimum
  distance from any input to any output is 3.

  The diameter of a communication net is the largest distance from an input
  to an output.  In this example, the largest distance is from input 0 to
  output 2 of length 7, so the diameter is 7.

  Latency depends on how packets are routed.  If you choose a shortest
  path routing, then the worst I/O pattern (permutation) will be the one
  that maps the maximum distance input to output, so the latency will
  equal the diameter.

  However, a shortest-path routing may be pretty congested, so we're
  usually more interested in the worst latency among the
  minimum-congestion routings.  But in this example, the shortest path
  routing is also the minimum congestion routing, so the latency is any
  case equals the diameter, namely 7.
