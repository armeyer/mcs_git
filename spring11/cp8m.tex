\section*{Appendix: The Mating Ritual}

The \emph{Mating Ritual} takes place over several days.  The
following events happen each day:

{\bf Morning: } Each girl stands on her balcony.  Each boy stands under
the balcony of his favorite among the girls on his list, and he serenades
her.  If a boy has no girls left on his list, he stays home and does his
6.042 homework.

{\bf Afternoon: } Each girl who has one or more suitors serenading her,
says to her favorite suitor, ``We might get engaged.  Come back
tomorrow.''  To the others, she says, ``No.  I will never marry you!  Take
a hike!''

\textbf{Evening}: Any boy who is told by a girl to take a hike, crosses that
girl off his list.

\textbf{Termination condition}: When every girl has at most one suitor,
the ritual ends with each girl marrying her suitor, if she has one.
