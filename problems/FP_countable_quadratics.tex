\begin{problem}
A real number is called \emph{quadratic} when it is a root of a
degree two polynomial with integer coefficients.
Explain why there are only countably many quadratic reals.

\begin{solution}
The triples of integer coefficients of integer quadratic polynomials
are countable, and since each such polynomial contributes at most two
roots, we can list the roots as we list the triples.
\end{solution}
