\begin{problem}
% Tests understanding of RSA encryption strategies

Ben Bitdiddle decided to encrypt all his data using RSA.
Unfortunately, he lost his private key.  He has been looking for it
all night, and suddenly a genie emerges from his lamp.  He offers Ben
a quantum computer that can perform exactly one procedure on large
numbers $e,d,n$.  Which of the following procedures should Ben choose
to recover his data?

\iffalse (No partial credit will be given for this problem, and no
explanation is necessary.)\fi

\begin{itemize}
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Find $\gcd(e, d)$.
\item  Find the prime factorization of $n$.
\item  Determine whether $n$ is prime.
\item  Find $\rem{e^d}{n}$.
\item  Find the inverse of $e$ modulo $n$ (the inverse of $e$ in $\Zmod{n})$.
\item  Find the inverse of $e$ modulo $\phi(n)$.
%\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Find the prime factorization of $n$.
\item Find the inverse of $e$ modulo $\phi(n)$.
\end{itemize}
When the RSA public key is $(e,n)$, we could find the secret key the
same way the receiver does: by calculating $\phi(n)$.  Then
the secret key is the inverse of $e$ modulo $\phi(n)$.

We already know ``fast'' procedures---with running time proportional
to a at most a little more than the square of the length of the
decimal representations of $e,d,n$---for all the other items.
\end{solution}
