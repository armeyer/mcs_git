\begin{problem}
  Scholars through the ages have identified \emph{twenty} fundamental
  human virtues: honesty, generosity, loyalty, prudence, completing
  the weekly course reading-response, etc.  At the beginning of the
  term, every student in Math for Computer Science possessed exactly
  \emph{eight} of these virtues.  Furthermore, every student was
  unique; that is, no two students possessed exactly the same set of
  virtues.  The Math for Computer Science course staff must select
  \emph{one} additional virtue to impart to each student by the end of
  the term.  Prove that there is a way to select an additional virtue
  for each student so that every student is unique at the end of the
  term as well.

  \hint Look for a matching in an appropriately defined bipartite graph. Be sure to clearly specify your (left and right) vertices and edges.

  % Look for a matching in an appropriate bipartite graph. What are your vertices? Edges?

  % Suggestion: Use \idx{Hall's theorem} or similar.  Try various interpretations for the vertices on the left and right sides of your \idx{bipartite graph}.

\begin{solution}
Construct a bipartite graph $G$ as follows.  The vertices on
on the left are all students and the vertices on the right are all
subsets of nine virtues.  There is an edge between a student and a set
of 9 virtues if the student already has 8 of those virtues.

Each vertex on the left has degree 12, since each student can learn
one of 12 additional virtues.  The vertices on the right have degree
at most 9, since each set of 9 virtues has only 9 subsets of size 8.
So this bipartite graph is \idx{degree-constrained}, and therefore, by
Lemma~\bref{lem:no_bottleneck_degree_constrained}, there is a matching
for the students.  Thus, if each student is taught the additional
virtue in the set of 9 virtues with whom he or she is matched, then
every student is unique at the end of the term.
\end{solution}
