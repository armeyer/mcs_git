\begin{problem} Suppose that you have a regular deck of cards arranged as
follows, from top to bottom:
\[
A \heartsuit\ 2 \heartsuit \dots K \heartsuit\ 
A \spadesuit\ 2 \spadesuit \dots K \spadesuit\ 
A \clubsuit\ 2 \clubsuit \dots K \clubsuit\ 
A \diamondsuit\ 2 \diamondsuit \dots K \diamondsuit
\]

Only two operations on the deck are allowed: \emph{inshuffling} and
\emph{outshuffling}.  In both, you begin by cutting the deck exactly in
half, taking the top half into your right hand and the bottom into
your left.  Then you shuffle the two halves together so that the cards
are perfectly interlaced; that is, the shuffled deck consists of one
card from the left, one from the right, one from the left, one from
the right, etc.  The top card in the shuffled deck comes from the
right hand in an outshuffle and from the left hand in an inshuffle.

\begin{problemparts}

\ppart Model this problem as a state machine.

\begin{solution}
Let the set of states $Q$ be all the possible orderings of
the deck of cards.  Let the set of start states $Q_0$ consist of the
single ordering listed above.  For each state $(c_1, \ldots c_{52}) \in
Q$, there are two transitions in $\delta$:

\begin{align*}
(c_1, \dots c_{52})
	& \rightarrow 
		(c_1, c_{27}, c_2, c_{28}, \dots, c_{26}, c_{52}) \\
(c_1, \dots c_{52})
	& \rightarrow 
		(c_{27}, c_1, c_{28}, c_2, \dots, c_{52}, c_{26})
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\ppart Use the Invariant Theorem to prove that you can not make
the entire first half of the deck black through a sequence of
inshuffles and outshuffles.

\begin{solution}
The proof uses the Invariant Theorem.  Define two cards to
be {\em opposites} if the sum of their positions is 53.  For example,
the top card is opposite the bottom card, the second card from the top
is opposite the second from the bottom, etc.

Let $P$ be the property that $A \heartsuit$ is opposite $K
\diamondsuit$, $2 \heartsuit$ is opposite $Q \diamondsuit$, etc., as
in the initial configuration.  We claim that $P$ is a preserved invariant.
Suppose that $P$ holds for a given state and consider the two types of
transition out of that state.  Note that, for both types of
transition, cards in opposite positions are mapped to opposite
positions.  Therefore, the property $P$ still holds.  Thus, $P$ is preserved.

Note that $P$ holds for the start state by definition.
However, the $P$ cannot hold when all black cards are in the
top half of the deck; in that case, every black card is opposite a red
card.  Therefore, by the Invariant Theorem, that state is not
reachable.
\end{solution}

\end{problemparts}

Note: Discovering a suitable invariant can be difficult!  The standard
approach is to identify a bunch of reachable states and then look for
a pattern, some feature that they all share.\footnote{If this does not
work, consider twitching and drooling until someone takes the problem
away.}
