\begin{problem}
In the context of formal series, a number $r$ may be used
to indicate the sequence
\[
(r,0,0,\dots,0,\dots).
\]
For example the number 1 may be used to indicate the identity series
$I$ and 0 may indicate the zero series $Z$.  Whether ``$r$''
means the number or the sequence is supposed to be clear from context.

Verify that in the ring of formal power series, 
\[
r \otimes (g_0,g_1,g_2, \dots) = (rg_0, rg_1, rg_2, \dots).
\]
In particular,
\[
-(g_0,g_1,g_2, \dots) = -1 \otimes (g_0,g_1,g_2, \dots).
\]
