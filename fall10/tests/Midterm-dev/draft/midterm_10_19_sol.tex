Let $G_0=1$, $G_1=2$, $G_2=4$, and define
\begin{equation}\label{Pn}
G_n =  G_{n-1} +2G_{n-2} + G_{n-3}
\end{equation}
for $n \geq 3$.  Show by induction that $G_n\leq 3^n$ for all $n \geq
0$.

\solution{

The proof is by strong induction with hypothesis $P(n) := G_n\leq 3^n$.

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Base Cases}

\textbf{$n=0$:} $G_0 = 1 = 3^0$.

\textbf{$n=1$:} $G_1 = 2 < 3 = 3^1$.

\textbf{$n=2$:} $G_2 =f 4 < 9 < 3^2$.

\textbf{Inductive Step}:
Assume $n \geq 2$ and $P(k)$ for all $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$.
\begin{align*}
G_{n+1}
& = G_n +2G_{n-1} + G_{n-2} & \text{by~\eqref{Pn}}\\
& \leq 3^n + (2)3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} & \text{by induction hypothesis}\\
& = 3^{n-2} [3^2 + (2)3 + 1]\\
& = 3^{n-2} [(3 + 1)^2]\\
& = 3^{n-2} 4^2\\
& = 3^{n-2} 16\\
& < 3^{n-2} 27\\
& = 3^{n-2} 3^3\\
& = 3^{n+1}

In the game of Squares and Circles, the players (you and your computer) start with a sequence of shapes: some circles and some squares. On each move a player selects two shapes. These two are replaced with a single one according to the following rule:

Identical shapes are replaced with a square. Different shapes are replaced with a circle.

At the end of the game, when only one shape remains, you are a winner if the remaining shape is a circle. Otherwise, your computer wins.

Find a number $x \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 112\}$ such that $18x \equiv 1 \pmod{113}$.

\solution{

We can do this using the pulverizer.  Specifically, if we find a pair $(s, t)$ such that $18s + 113t = 1$, then we know that $18s \equiv 1 \pmod{113}$.
\[
\begin{array}{ccccrcl}
x & \quad & y & \quad & \rem(x,y) & = & x - q \cdot y \\ \hline
113 && 18 && 5  & = &   113 - 6 \cdot 18 \\
18 && 5 && 3   & = &   18 - 3 \cdot 5 \\
&&&&            & = &   18 - 3 \cdot (113 - 6 \cdot 18) \\
&&&&            & = &   -1 \cdot 113 + 19 \cdot 18 \\
5 && 3  && 2   & = &   5 - 3 \\
&&&&						& = & (113 - 6 \cdot 18) - (-1 \cdot 113 + 19 \cdot 18) \\
&&&&            & = &   (2 \cdot 113 - 25 \cdot 18) \\
3 && 2 && 1 & = & 3 - 2 \\
&&&&            & = & (-1 \cdot 113 + 19 \cdot 18 ) - (2 \cdot 113 - 25 \cdot 18) \\
&&&&            & = &   \fbox{$-3 \cdot 113 + 44 \cdot 18$} \\
\end{array}
\]
So the multiplicative inverse of $18$ modulo $113$ is $44$.

\ppart{7}
Find a number $y \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 112\}$ such that $18^{112111} \equiv y \pmod{113}$
\hint{What power of $18$ is $x$ equivalent to modulo $113$?}
\solution{By Fermat's Theorem, since $113$ is prime and $113$ and $18$ are relatively prime, it must be that
\[18\cdot 18^{111} \equiv 18^{113-1} \equiv 1 \pmod {113},\]
so $x \equiv 111 \pmod {113}$.
As a result,
\[18^{112111} \equiv 18^{112\cdot 1000 + 111} \equiv {18^{112}}^1000 \cdot 18^{111} \equiv 1^{1000} \cdot x \equiv x \equiv 44 \pmod {113},\]
so the answer is $44$.

Define a number
$S_p = 1^p + 2^p +3^p + \ldots (p-1)^p.$
You will show in this problem that if $p$ is an odd prime, then $p|S_p$.
\bparts
\ppart{5}
 Use Fermat's Theorem to show that $S_p \equiv 1+2+\ldots + (p-1) \pmod p$.
 \solution
 {
 \begin{eqnarray*}
 S_p &\equiv& 1^p + 2^p + \ldots (p-1)^p\\
 & \equiv& 1\cdot1^{p-1} + 2\cdot2^{p-1} + \ldots + (p-1)\cdot (p-1)^{p-1}\\
 & \equiv& 1\cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + \ldots + (p-1) \cdot 1\\
 & \equiv & 1 + 2 + \ldots + (p-1) \pmod p
 \end{eqnarray*}
 }
 \ppart{5}
 Show that $p|(1+2+\ldots + (p-1))$ and explain why this implies that $p$ divides $S_p$.
 \solution{
 $1+2+\ldots + (p-1) = \frac{(p-1)p}2.$\\
 $p$ is odd, so $p-1$ is even, which means $\frac{p-1}2$ is some integer $k$. Therefore
 \[1+2+\ldots + (p-1) = kp,\]
 so $p|(1+2+\ldots + (p-1))$. As a consequence, $1+2+\ldots + (p-1) \equiv 0 \pmod p$. Therefore
 \[S_p \equiv 1+2+\ldots + (p-1) \equiv 0 \pmod p,\]
 so $p|S_p$.

\begin{problem}{20}
Consider a strongly connected directed graph with $\mathrm{indegree}(v) = \mathrm{outdegree}(v)$ for all $v \in V$. We will prove such a graph has a (directed) Eulerean tour, by considering its longest path.

\ppart {10} Show the longest sequence of adjacent edges (walk or tour) where no edges are repeated is a tour.

\solution{Consider the longest walk or tour in the graph (whichever is longer). We want to show it is indeed a tour. By way of contradiction, suppose not. Then we have a walk where each edge is different and the starting node $v_s$ is different from the end node. The starting node may have appeared in the walk on several occasions but not at the end. We can count the number of edges used on each occasion. There is the initial start edge.  From then on the rest of the edges are paired: one in for each one out of $v_s$. Hence we used up one more outgoing edge than we used incoming edges. Hence we can extend the path backwards by prefixing that missing incoming edge to $v_s$, which contradicts our walk was as long as possible.}

\ppart {10} Show no directed edge is left out of the longest possible walk or tour. 
\solution{Suppose some edge $(u,w)$ is left out from the longest path. Since the graph is strongly connected, there is a shortest path from $u$  to some $v$ in the longest tour. We can then construct an even longer path: $u,w, \cdots  v, \cdots, v$ Where we prefix the path onto the existing cycle.}
