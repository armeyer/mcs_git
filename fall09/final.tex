\section{Grid Networks}

A \term{grid} is a simple communication network with low congestion.  A
grid with $n = 4$ inputs and outputs is pictured in the following figure.

\mfigure{!}{3in}{figures/grid}

The \term{diameter} of a communication net is the largest distance between
any input/output pair.

The \term{congestion of a routing} is the maximum number of paths that
travel through a single node for that routing.

The \term{congestion of a net} is the maximum number of paths through a
single node over all possible permutations of inputs and outputs, assuming
that routing is chosen to minimize congestion.

The \term{latency of a routing} is the length of the longest path in that
routing.
 
The \term{latency for minimum congestion (LMC)} of a net is the worst
latency necessary among routings that minimize congestion.

The \term{congestion for minimum latency (CML)} of a net is the worst
congestion necessary among routings that minimize latency.

\begin{theorem*} 
The congestion of an $n$-input array is at most 2. 
\end{theorem*} 
 
\begin{proof} 
  Let $\pi$ be any permutation, and suppose $\pi(i)=j$.  To route a packet 
  from input $i$ to output $j$, use the path from input $i$ to the right 
  along row $i$ until column $j$.  Then continue the path downward along 
  column $j$ to output $j$. 
 
  With this routing for $\pi$, the switch in row $k$ and column $l$ 
  transmits at most two packets: the packet originating at input $k$ and 
  the packet destined for column $l$. 
\end{proof} 

\section{DAGs and Orders}

A \term{chain} is a totally ordered subset of a partially ordered set.

An \term{antichain} is a set of mutually incomparable elements.

The graph of a \term{positive path relation} has all edges that would
      be in the relation, and all edges implied by transitivity.

A \term{topological sort} of a DAG is an ordering of its vertices
      such that each vertex is 'greater' than all vertices to which it has
      an outbount edge.

\section{The Pulverizer}
Euclid's algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers relies on
repeated application of the equation: 
\[
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, \rem{a}{b})
\]
For example, we can compute the GCD of 259 and 70 as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{rclcl}
\gcd(259, 70)
    & = & \gcd(70, 49) & \quad & \text{since $\rem{259}{70} = 49$}\\
    & = & \gcd(49, 21) && \text{since $\rem{70}{49} = 21$} \\
    & = & \gcd(21, 7) && \text{since $\rem{49}{21} = 7$} \\
    & = & \gcd(7, 0) && \text{since $\rem{21}{7} = 0$} \\
    & = & 7.
\end{array}
\]
The Pulverizer goes through the same steps, but requires some extra
bookkeeping along the way: as we compute $\gcd(a, b)$, we keep track
of how to write each of the remainders (49, 21, and 7, in the example)
as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$ (this is worthwhile, because
our objective is to write the last nonzero remainder, which is the
GCD, as such a linear combination).  For our example, here is this
extra bookkeeping:
\[
\begin{array}{ccccrcl}
x & \quad & y & \quad & \rem{x}{y} & = & x - q \cdot y \\ \hline
259 && 70 && 49 & = &   259 - 3 \cdot 70 \\
70 && 49 && 21  & = &   70 - 1 \cdot 49 \\
&&&&            & = &   70 - 1 \cdot (259 - 3 \cdot 70) \\
&&&&            & = &   -1 \cdot 259 + 4 \cdot 70 \\
49 && 21 && 7   & = &   49 - 2 \cdot 21 \\
&&&&            & = &   (259 - 3 \cdot 70) -
                                2 \cdot (-1 \cdot 259 + 4 \cdot 70) \\
&&&&            & = &   \fbox{$3 \cdot 259 - 11 \cdot 70$} \\
21 && 7 && 0
\end{array}
\]

\section{RSA Encryption}

\begin{description}

\item[Beforehand] The receiver creates a public key and a secret key
as follows.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Generate two distinct primes, $p$ and $q$.

\item Let $n = pq$.

\item Select an integer $e$ such that $\gcd(e, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1$.\\ The
{\em public key} is the pair $(e, n)$.  This should be distributed
widely.

\item Compute $d$ such that $de \equiv 1 \pmod{(p-1)(q-1)}$.\\ The
{\em secret key} is the pair $(d, n)$.  This should be kept hidden!

\end{enumerate}

\item[Encoding] The sender encrypts message $m$ to produce $m^\prime$ using
the public key:
\[
m' = \rem{m^e}{n}.
\]

\item[Decoding] The receiver decrypts message $m'$ back to message $m$
using the secret key:
\[
m = \rem{(m')^d}{n}.
\]

\section{Generating Functions}

Let $[x^n]F(x)$ denote the coefficient of $x^n$ in the power series
for $F(x)$.  Then,
\begin{equation}\label{1axk}
[x^n]\paren{\frac{1}{\paren{1-\alpha x}^k}} = \binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\alpha^n.
\end{equation}

\iffalse

\section{Convolution Counting}
Let
\begin{align*}
A(x) & = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n, & B(x) & =
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n x^n, & C(x) & = A(x) \cdot B(x) =
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n.
\end{align*}
Then
\[
c_n = a_0 b_n + a_1 b_{n-1} + a_2 b_{n-2} + \cdots + a_n b_0.
\]

\begin{mathrule*}[Convolution Rule]
  Let $A(x)$ be the generating function for selecting items from set
  $\mathcal{A}$, and let $B(x)$ be the generating function for selecting
  items from set $\mathcal{B}$.  If $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are
  disjoint, then the generating function for selecting items from the
  union $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$ is the product $A(x) \cdot B(x)$.
\end{mathrule*}
\fi


\section{Finding a Generating Function}
The Fibonacci numbers are defined by:
\begin{align*}
f_0 & \eqdef 0 \\
f_1 & \eqdef 1 \\
f_n & \eqdef f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} \qquad \text{(for $n \geq 2$)}
\end{align*}

Let $F$ be the generating function for the Fibonacci numbers,
that is,
\[
F(x) \eqdef f_0 + f_1 x + f_2 x^2 + f_3 x^3 + f_4 x^4 + \cdots
\]
So we need to derive a generating function whose series has
coefficients:
\[
\ang{0,\ 1,\ f_1 + f_0,\ f_2 + f_1,\ f_3 + f_2,\ \dots}
\]
Now we observe that
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccccl}
  & \langle & 0, & 1, & 0, & 0, & 0, & \dots & \rangle
    &     & x \\
+ & \langle & 0, & f_0, & f_1, & f_2, & f_3, & \dots & \rangle
    &     & x F(x) \\
+ & \langle & 0, & 0, & f_0, & f_1, & f_2, & \dots & \rangle
    &     & x^2 F(x) \\ \hline
  & \langle & 0, & 1 + f_0, & f_1 + f_0, & f_2 + f_1, & f_3 + f_2, & \dots & \rangle
    &     & x + x F(x) + x^2 F(x) \\
\end{array}
\]
%
This sequence is almost identical to the right sides of the
Fibonacci equations.  The one blemish is that the second term is
$1 + f_0$ instead of simply 1.  But since $f_0 = 0$, the second
term is ok.

So we have
\begin{align}
F(x) & = x + x F(x) + x^2 F(x). \notag\\
F(x) & = \frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}.\label{Fx}
\end{align}

\section{Partial Fractions}

Here's a particular case of the Partial Fraction Rule that should be
enough to illustrate the general Rule.  Let
\[
r(x) \eqdef \frac{p(x)}{(1-\alpha x)^2 (1-\beta x) (1-\gamma x)^3}
\]
where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are distinct complex numbers, and $p(x)$ is
a polynomial of degree less than the demoninator, namely, less than 6.
Then there are unique numbers $a_1,a_2,b,c_1,c_2,c_3 \in \complexes$ such
that
\[
r(x)
= \frac{a_1}{1-\alpha x} + \frac{a_2}{(1-\alpha x)^2}
+ \frac{b}{1-\beta x}
+ \frac{c_1}{1-\gamma x} + \frac{c_2}{(1-\gamma x)^2} + \frac{c_3}{(1-\gamma x)^3}
\]
