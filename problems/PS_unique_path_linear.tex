\begin{problem}
Digraph $G$ has the \emph{unique path property} when, for any finite
nonempty set of vertices of $G$, there is a unique directed path going
through exactly these vertices.

\bparts

\ppart Prove that if $G$ is a linear strict partial order, then $G$
has the unique path property.

\begin{solution}
\TBA{by induction on size of finite set?}
\end{solution}

\iffalse
\hint Notice that the graph whose vertices are the rational numbers
$\rationals$ , with a edge from $r$ to $s$ whenever $r < s$, has the
unique path property for finite sets, but not for infinite sets.
\fi

\ppart Prove conversely that if $G$ has the unique path property, then
the positive path relation of $G$ is a linear strict partial order.

\begin{solution}
