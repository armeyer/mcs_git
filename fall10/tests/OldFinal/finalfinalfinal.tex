Prove that for all $n \in \mathbb N$, the following identity holds
$$\sum_{i =1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.$$

\solution{
By induction on $n \ge 1$, with induction hypothesis
\[
P(n): \sum_{i=0}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]
for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ 

\textbf{Base case} ($n=1$): 
\[
\frac{1(1+1)(2+1)}{6} = \frac{6}{6} = 1 = 1^2
\]

\textbf{Inductive step}: 
Assume $P(n)$, we need to show that $P(n+1)$ holds.

\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=0}^{n+1} i^2 & = (\sum_{i=0}^{n} i^2) + (n+1)^2 \\
                     & = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + (n+1)^2 \\
                     & = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1) + 6(n+1)^2}{6} \\
                     & = \frac{(n+1)(2n^2+n+6n+6)}{6}      \\
                     & = \frac{(n+1)(2n^2+7n+6)}{6}        \\
                     & = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6}        \\
                     & = \frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)(2(n+1)+1)}{6} \\       
                     & \Rightarrow P(n+1) 
\end{align*}
as required.

We have shown that $P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)$.
Thus, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

\begin{problem}
{\bf [20 points]}
Coin-Flip is a 2 player game. Each player wins 
with probability exactly $0.5$. There are no ties.

$n$ people are playing a Coin-Flip tournament. 
Every person plays a Coin-Flip game with every other person exactly once.
Thus everybody plays $n-1$ games.
The outcomes of all the games are mutually independent of one
another.

We say that the tournament is a {\em success} if for every $i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$, there
is exactly one player, which we will refer to as $p_i$, with exactly $i$ wins.

\bparts
\ppart
{\bf [10 points]} 
Prove that if the tournament is a success, then for any integers $j,k$ with $0 \leq k < j \leq n-1$, $p_j$ defeats $p_k$.

\solution{
We prove it by induction on $k$. The inductive hypothesis $P(k)$ is 
that for all $0 \leq \ell \leq k$ and all $\ell < j < n$, $p_j$ defeats 
$p_{\ell}$.

The base case is $k = 0$. Now $p_0$ loses all $n-1$ games. Thus, for every 
$j > 0$, $p_j$ defeats $p_0$. Suppose $P(k)$ and let us show $P(k+1)$. 
Since the tournament is a sucess, $p_{k+1}$ wins exactly $k+1$ games. 
Because $P(k)$ holds, $p_{k+1}$ defeats the $k+1$ players $p_0, p_1, 
\ldots, p_k$. Thus, for all $k+1 < j < n$, $p_j$ defeats $p_{k+1}$. So 
$P(k+1)$ holds.
}

\ppart
{\bf [6 points]} 
What is the probability that the tournament will be a success?

\solution{
 Let $\pi$ be a permutation of $\{0, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$ and define the 
event $\mathcal{E}_{\pi}$ to be that the tournament is a success with 
players $p_i$ winning exactly $i$ games, where $p_i$ is the $\pi(i)$th 
player. Then the events $\mathcal{E}_{\pi}$ and $\mathcal{E}_{\sigma}$ are 
disjoint for $\pi \neq \sigma$. Moreover, by symmetry, 
$\Pr[\mathcal{E}_{\pi}] = \Pr[\mathcal{E}_{\sigma}]$ for all permutations 
$\sigma, \pi$. Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the event the tournament is a success. 
Since the events are disjoint,
$$\Pr[\mathcal{E}] = \sum_{\pi} \Pr[\mathcal{E}_{\pi}] = n! 
\Pr[\mathcal{E}_{\sigma}],$$
where $\sigma$ is some fixed permutation. Now $\mathcal{E}_{\sigma}$ 
determines all the outcomes of the games. As there are ${n \choose 2}$ 
games, we have
$$\Pr[\mathcal{E}_{\sigma}] = \left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{{n \choose 
2}}.$$
In total,
$$\Pr[\mathcal{E}] = n! \left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{{n \choose 2}}.$$
}
\ppart
{\bf [4 points]}
 Show that your answer to part (b) is $o(1)$.
\solution{ We have,
$$\Pr[\mathcal{E}] \leq n^n \left(\frac{1}{2} \right )^{{n \choose 2}} = 
2^{n \log n}\left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{{n \choose 2}} = \left (\frac{1}{2} 
\right )^{{n \choose 2} - n \log n}.$$
Now, ${n \choose 2} - n \log n = \Omega(n^2)$, so there is a positive 
constant $c$ such that for sufficiently large $n$, this probability is at 
most
$$\left (\frac{1}{2} \right )^{c n^2},$$
which for sufficiently large $n$, is clearly less than any positive 
constant, and thus is $o(1)$.}

A person is passing time by advancing a token on the set of natural numbers. In the beginning, a token is placed on $0$.

The person keeps playing {\em moves} forever. Each move proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First the person tosses a fair coin (with heads/tails equally likely).
\item Suppose the token is currently placed on $n$. If heads came up, then the person moves the token to $n+3$, otherwise he moves the token to $n+4$.
\end{enumerate}



For each $n \in \mathbb N$, let $E_n$ be the event "There was a move on which the token landed on $n$". Let $p_n = \Pr[E_n]$.

Exactly 1/5th of the people in a town have Beaver Fever$^\copyright$.

There are two tests for Beaver Fever, TEST1 and TEST2.
When a person goes to a doctor to test for Beaver Fever, with probability
$2/3$ the doctor conducts TEST1 on him and with probability $1/3$
the doctor conducts TEST2 on him.

When TEST1 is done on a person, the outcome is as follows:

\vspace{.15in}
\solution{We can calculate this probability by computing

There are 104 cards.  There are 5 cards in a hand.  Order does not matter.  The total number of possible hands is:

$\binom{104}{5}$

There are 52 possible card faces, and we can choose 5 of them if no identical cards are allowed.  Additionally, each card can be from either deck 1 or deck 2.  Therefore the number of hands with no identical cards, chosen from 2 decks is:
%
\[
\binom{52}{5} \cdot 2^5

Therefore the probability of drawing a hand with no identical cards is:

\solution{This can be solved by a similar approach.  A hand of this type can be distinguished by the face (suit and value) of the repeated card, and by the faces of the 3 non-repeated cards.  There are 52 possible values for the face of the repeated card.  There are $\binom{51}{3}$ possible faces for the non-repeated cards, since none of these can be repeated.  Each of these could come from either the 1st deck or the 2nd deck.  There are  $\binom{104}{5}$ possible hands, as before.  So the probability of getting a hand with exactly one pair of identical cards is:
