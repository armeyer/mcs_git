The two graphs above are isomorphic.  This means that there exists an
edge-preserving bijection from the set of vertices of the first graph
to the set of vertices of the second graph.

How many such bijections are there?

\begin{solution}
10

We may map $u_{1}$ to any of the 5 vertices of the second graph, and
then $u_{2}$ to either of its 2 neighbors.  The remaining vertices are
then uniquely determined.
\end{solution}

The two graphs above (call them $G$ and $H$) are not isomorphic.

Indicate which of the following assertions can prove this fact.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
$H$ has a vertex of degree~4, but $G$ does not.

\item
$u_{1}$ has degree~3, but $v_{1}$ has degree~2.

\item
$G$ has four vertices of degree~3, but $H$ only has two vertices of
degree~3.

\item
$G$ has a vertex named $u_{1}$, but $H$ does not.

\item
$G$ has three vertices that form a right triangle, but no three
  vertices of $H$ form a right triangle.

\item
$G$ has an edge that is incident to two vertices of degree~3, but $H$
  does not.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

1
3


Note that assertion 6 mentions properties that \emph{are} preserved
under isomorphism, and so if it were true, it could prove that $G$
and~$H$ are not isomorphic.  Unfortunately, the assertion isn't true;
both graphs actually have an edge that is incident to two vertices of
degree~3.
