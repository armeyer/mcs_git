\begin{problem}
Prove that the set $\paren{\integers^{+}}^*$ of all finite sequences of
positive integers is countable.

\hint If $s \in \paren{\integers^{+}}^*$, let sum($s$) be the sum of
the successive integers in $s$.

\begin{solution}   
There are only a finite number sequences of nonnegative integers with
sum $n$: all the elements in the sequence are $\leq n$, and the length
of the sequence is at most $n$.  No explicit bound on the number of
such sequences was required.  \iffalse (Since there are at most $n^i$
such sequences of length $i$, a coarse bound on the number of
sequences with sum at most $n$ is $(n+1) \cdot n^n$.\fi

So to list all the elements in $\paren{\integers^{+}}^*$ just list all
the elements in order of their sum, with elements with the same sum
ordered arbitrarily (say by dictionary order).  This list defines a
bijection with \nngint.
\end{solution}
