\begin{problem}
A guard is going to release exactly two of the three prisoners,
Sauron, Voldemort, and Bunny Foo Foo, according to the following distribution:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sauron and Voldemort with probability $\frac{1}{2}$
\item Sauron and Bunny Foo Foo with probability $\frac{1}{6}$
\item Voldemort and Bunny Foo Foo with probability $\frac{1}{3}$
\end{itemize}
The guard will truthfully tell
Sauron the name of one of the prisoners to be released.  We're
interested in the following events:

\begin{description}

\item[\ \ $S$:] \emph{S}auron is released.

\item[\textbf{``$F$''}:] The guard says that \emph{F}oo Foo will be released.

\item[\textbf{``$V$''}:] The guard says that \emph{V}oldemort will be released.

\end{description}
So
\begin{equation}\label{Sreleaseprob}
\prob{S} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3}.
\end{equation}

The guard has two rules for choosing whom he names:
\begin{itemize}

\item never say that Sauron will be released,

\item if both Foo Foo and Voldemort are getting released, say ``Foo Foo''
  with probability 1/2 and ``Voldemort'' with probability 1/2.

\end{itemize}

\bparts

\ppart Use a tree diagram to derive a probability space suitable for
representing the events above.  Indicate which outcomes are in each of
the above events.

that Voldemort will be released, then his own probability of release
will be reduced.

because
\[
