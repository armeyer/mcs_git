\begin{problem}
Show that
\[
(\forall x \exists y.\; P(x,y)) \implies \forall z.\; P(z,z)
\]
is not valid by describing a counter-model.

\begin{solution}
Let $P(x,y)$ mean $x \neq y$.  Then the conclusion $\forall z.\; z \neq z$
is always false, but in any domain with two or more elements, the
hypothesis is true.
\end{solution}
\end{problem}
