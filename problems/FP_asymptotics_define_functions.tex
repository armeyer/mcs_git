\begin{problem} %\textbf{Asymptotics}
\mbox{}

\begin{problemparts} 

\ppart\label{eswn} Indicate which of the following asymptotic
relations below on the set of nonnegative real-valued functions are
equivalence relations (\textbf{E}), strict partial orders
(\textbf{S}), weak partial orders (\textbf{W}), or \emph{none} of the
above (\textbf{N}).

\begin{staffnotes}
Refer students to Section~\bref{prop_summary_sec} of the notes if needed.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

\item\label{f=og} $f=o(g)$, the ``little Oh'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\begin{solution}
\textbf{S}
\end{solution}

\item\label{f=bigOg} $f=O(g)$, the ``big Oh'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\begin{solution}
\textbf{N} because it is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric.
\end{solution}

\item $f \sim g$, the ``asymptotically equal'' relation. \hfill \examrule
\begin{solution}
\textbf{E}
\end{solution}

\item $f=\Theta(g)$, the ``Theta'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\begin{solution}
\textbf{E}
\end{solution}

\item\label{fOGand} $f=O(g) \QAND \QNOT(g=O(f))$. \hfill \examrule

\begin{solution}
\textbf{S}.
\end{solution}

\end{enumerate}

\ppart Indicate the implications among the items~\eqref{f=og}--\eqref{fOGand} in
part~\eqref{eswn}.  For example,
\begin{itemize}

\item item~\eqref{f=og} \QIMP\ item~\eqref{f=bigOg}.

\end{itemize}
Briefly explain your answers.

\begin{solution}
\[\begin{array}{rclclr}
     f\sim g & \QIMPLIES & f = \Theta(g)\ \QAND\ f= O(g) & \text{because}\\
\lim (f/g)=1 & \QIMPLIES & \lim (f/g) = \lim (g/f) = 1 < \infty.
\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{rcllr}
      f = o(g) & \QIMPLIES & f=O(g)              & \QAND \QNOT(g=O(f)) & \text{because}\\
\lim (f/g) = 0 & \QIMPLIES & \lim (f/g) < \infty & \QAND \lim (g/f) = \infty.
\end{array}\]


\[\begin{array}{rcllr}
      f = \Theta(g) & \QIMPLIES & f=O(g) & \text{(by definition of $\Theta$)}.
\end{array}\]


It is not true that $f=O(g)$ and $\QNOT(g=O(f))$ implies $f=o(g)$.
For example, let $g(n) \eqdef n$ and $f \eqdef g \cdot c_{\text{even}}$ where
\[
c_{\text{even}}(n) =
\begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if $n$ is even},\\
  0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]

\end{solution}

% Commented out for spring15, as an earlier class problem already requires realizing that two given functions are big-O-incomparable.
\iffalse
\problempart
Define two functions $f, g$ that are incomparable under big Oh:
\[
f \neq O(g) \QAND g \neq O(f).
\]

\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
One example is,
\[
f(n) \eqdef \begin{cases}            
n & \text{if $n$ is odd},\\
0   & \text{if $n$ is even}, 
\end{cases}\qquad
g(n) \eqdef \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if $n$ is odd},\\
n   & \text{if $n$ is even}, 
\end{cases}
\]
which can also be described by the formulas
\[
f(n) \eqdef n\, \sin^2\paren{\frac{n\pi}{2}}, \qquad g(n) \eqdef n\, \cos^2\paren{\frac{n\pi}{2}}.
\]
\end{solution}
\fi
