\begin{problem}
The running time of an algorithm $A$ is described by the recurrence
$T(n)=7T(n/2)+n^2$.  A competing algorithm $A'$ has a running time of
$T'(n)=aT'(n/4)+n^2$.  For what values of $a$ is $A'$ asymptotically
faster than $A$?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Using the Akra-Bazzi theorem, we have that for $T$, $k=1,
a_1 = 7, b_1 =1/2, g(n) = n^2$ and for $T'$, $k=1, a_1 = a, b_1 =1/4,
g(n) = n^2$.  In both cases, $g'(n) = 2n$ which is polynomially
bounded.  In the first case (for $T$), we have that $7\cdot(1/2)^p =
1$ or that $p = \log_2 7$.  In the second case (for $T'$), we have
that $a \cdot (1/4)^p = 1 \Rightarrow a \cdot (1/2)^{2p} = 1
\Rightarrow p = (1/2) \log_2 a$.  This gives

\[
T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_2 7} (1+ \int_1^n \frac{u^2}{u^{\log_2 7 + 1}} du)) =
\Theta(n^{\log_2 7})
\]
and 
\[
T'(n) = \Theta(n^{(\log_2 a)/2} (1+ \int_1^n \frac{u^2}{u^{(\log_2
a)/2 + 1}} du)) = \Theta(n^{(\log_2 a)/2} (1 + \int_1^n u^{1- (\log_2
a)/2} du)),
\]
so that if $(\log_2 a)/2 > 2$, we have that $T'(n) = \Theta(n^{(\log_2
a)/2})$ and if $(\log_2 a)/2 = 2$, we have that $T'(n) = \Theta(n^{(\log_2
a)/2} \log n) = \Theta(n^2 \log n)$ and if $(\log_2 a)/2 < 2$, we have
that $T'(n) = \Theta(n^2)$.

This means that for $A'$ to be asymptotically faster than $A$, we need to have
$(1/2) \log_2 a < \log_2 7$, or that $a < 7^2$.
Hence, $a < 49$.

\end{solution}
