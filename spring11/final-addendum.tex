\begin{itemize}

\item The exam is long, so a good strategy would be to skip hard parts
  and come back to them later after moving quickly through easy parts.

\item On \textbf{true}/\textbf{false} questions, you will get part
  credit for a correct answer of \textbf{false} even without the
  called-for counter-example.  So if you don't quickly see a
  counter-example, go on to the next question.

\item Problem 1(k) the $b$ should be \textbf{1}.

\item Problem 2(b), these are statements about \textbf{finite trees}.
  The last item should read 
 \begin{quote}
 \begin{itemize}

 \item For every finite graph (not necessarily a tree), there is one (a
   finite tree) that spans it.

 \end{itemize}
 \end{quote}

\item Problem 2(e), ``stable'' should be ``stationary.''

\item Problem 12(d), Write a formula solely in terms of the
  expressions given in part~(a):
  $\prob{B}$, $\prcond{Y}{B}$ and $\prcond{\bar{Y}}{\bar{B}}$.

\item In your proof for Problem 13, intelligible abuse of $\Theta()$
  notation will be accepted.  For example, writing ``$\Theta(x) \cdot
  \Theta(y) = \Theta(x \cdot y)$'' to abbreviate some proof steps
  would be OK.

\end{itemize}
