\begin{problem} Prove that $\log_9 12$ is irrational.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose to the contrary that $\log_9 12 =m/n$ for some integers $m$ and
  $n$.  Since $\log_9 12$ is positive, we may assume that $m$ and $n$ are
  also positive.  So we have
\begin{align}
\log_9 12 & = m/n \notag\\
9^{\log_9 12} & = 9^{m/n}  \notag\\
12 &= \paren{9^m}^{1/n} \notag\\
12^n & = 9^m \label{12n9m}
\end{align}
But this is impossible, since left hand side of~\eqref{12n9m} is even,
but, because $m$ is positive, the right hand side is odd.

This contradiction implies that $\log_9 12$ must be irrational.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
