Run TeX/LaTeX on chessfss.ins to unpack the dtx.
Put the files the .sty, the .def and all the .fd-files in
tex/latex/chessfss/.

You will also get two generic .enc-files.
Put them together with the two .pdf's
in doc/latex/chessfss/.

The ins-file suggest the following directories:

for the encoding-.def-files:
tex/latex/chessfss/enc

for the .fd-files of the skak-fonts:
tex/latex/chessfss/skak

for the .fd-files of the skaknew-fonts:
tex/latex/chessfss/skaknew

for the two generic .enc-files:
doc/latex/chessfss

If you have a docstrip.cfg which points to one of your texmf-tree e.g. with the content

\BaseDirectory{D:/texmf}
\UseTDS

AND IF ALL FOLDERS EXIST then the ins.file will unpack to this
folders. If you want the files to go to other locations you can
change the pathes in the .ins-file.

The dtx-file doesn't contain any documentation.
So running LaTeX on it makes no sense!



DOCUMENTATION

chessfss.pdf. There isn't a source for the documentation as it use some
local fonts and styles.

DESCRIPTION

This package offers commands to use and switch between chess
fonts. It use the LaTeX font selection scheme (nfss).

The package doesn't parse, format and print "Portable Game
Notation" (PGN) input like e.g. the packages skak or texmate.

The aim of the package is to offer writers of chess packages a
bundle of commands for fonts, so that they don't have to
implement all this commands for themselves. chessfss.sty is now
used in the version of skak.sty which you can find at
CTAN.
