Conditional Probability, Ch. 17

In Spring '13, most teams finished 20 or more minutes early, mainly
because staff was not adequately briefed to get discussions going as
directed in individual problems.  Also,
PS\_conditional\_probability\_problem\_errors did not make it into the
actual handout used in class.
