\begin{definition*}
A binary relation, $R$ is
\begin{itemize}

\item is a \term{function} when it has the $[\le 1\ \text{arrow
    \textbf{out}}]$ property.

\item is \term{surjective} when it has the $[\ge 1\ \text{arrows
    \textbf{in}}]$ property.  That is, every point in the righthand,
     codomain column has at least one arrow pointing to it.

\item is \term{total} when it has the $[\ge 1\ \text{arrows
       \textbf{out}}]$ property.

\item is \term{injective} when it has the $[\le 1\ \text{arrow
    \textbf{in}}]$ property.

\item is \term{bijective} when it has both the $[=1\ \text{arrow
    \textbf{out}}]$ and the $[=1\ \text{arrow \textbf{in}}]$ property.
