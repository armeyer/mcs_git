\begin{problem} A simple graph is \emph{triangle-free} when it has no
cycle of length three.

\bparts

\ppart\label{e2v4} Prove for any connected triangle-free planar graph
with $v>2$ vertices and $e$ edges,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e2v-4}
e \leq 2v - 4.
\end{equation}

%\hint Theorem~\bref{th:e2v}.

\begin{solution}
  The only fact about bipartite graphs used in the proof of
  Theorem~\bref{th:e2v}---that $e \leq 2v - 4$ for any planar
  bipartite graph---is that cycles in bipartite graphs must have
  length at least four.  Since the same is true for triangle-free
  graphs, the same bound on $e$ hold for othem.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{triangle-free} Show that any connected triangle-free planar
  graph has at least one vertex of degree three or less.

\begin{solution}
If $v \leq 4$, \emph{all} vertices have degree at most three,
  so the claim is immediate for $v\leq 4$.

  Also, by the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of degrees is $2e$ so the average
  degree is $2e/v$.  By part~\eqref{e2v4}, $2e/v \leq (4v-8)/v < 4$ for
  $v>2$.  But the average degree can be less than 4 only if at least one
  vertex has degree less than 4.

  It follows that for all $v > 0$, there is a vertex of degree three or
  less.
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that any connected triangle-free planar graph is
4-colorable.

%  \hint use part \eqref{triangle-free}.

\begin{solution}
\mbox{}

  \begin{proof} By strong induction on the number of vertices with the
  induction hypothesis that if an $n$-node graph is connected, planar
  and triangle-free then it is 4-colorable.

  \inductioncase{base case:} A planar graph with a single vertex is
  trivially connected, triangle-free and 1-colorable.

  \inductioncase{inductive step:} By part~\eqref{triangle-free}, any
  connected triangle-free planar graph $G$ has a vertex of degree 3 or
  less.  Removing this vertex and any incident edges results in a
  graph $H$ whose connected components are subgraphs of a planar graph
  and therefore planar.  They are also triangle-free since removing
  vertices/edges from a graph with no triangles cannot create
  triangles.  Since the components have strictly fewer vertices than
  $G$, the induction hypothesis implies each connected component is
  4-colorable and thus $H$ is 4-colorable.

  A 4-coloring of $G$ is then given by taking any 4-coloring of $H$
  and then coloring the removed vertex with a color not used for the
  (at most 3) adjacent vertices.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
