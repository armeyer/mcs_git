\begin{problem}{30}
Can raising an irrational number $a$ to an irrational power $b$ result in a
rational number? Provide a proof that it can by considering $\sqrt{3}^{\sqrt{2}}$
and using proof by cases.
\solution{
This proof is by cases. We will consider $\sqrt{3}^{\sqrt{2}}$, and there are
two cases.

\begin{itemize}

\item $\sqrt{3}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational. In this case, since $\sqrt{3}$ is
irrational and $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, we have found an $a$ and $b$ such that
both are irrational and $a^b$ is rational.

\item $\sqrt{3}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational. In this case, notice that
$(\sqrt{3}^{\sqrt{2}})^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{3}^{2} = 3$. Since $\sqrt{3}^{\sqrt{2}}$
and $\sqrt{2}$ are both irrational and $3$ is rational, we have found an
$a$ and $b$.

\end{itemize}

In all cases, we have found some irrational $a$ such that when raised to an
irrational power $b$, $a^b$ is rational.
