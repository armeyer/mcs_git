\begin{problem}
Explain why 1059 does not have an inverse modulo 1412.

\begin{solution}
1412 and 1059 are not relatively prime, so neither has an inverse
modulo the other.  In particular, they are both divisible by 353:
\[
\gcd(1059,1412) = \gcd(1059,1412-1059) = \gcd(1059, 353) = 353.
\]
\end{solution}
