\begin{problem}
A tennis tournament\footnote{Note: We are \emph{not} talking about ``tournament digraphs'' like the ones defined in the King Chicken problem. In this problem, the word ``tournament'' simply means ``competition.''} among a set of players consists of a series of
two-player matches.  Usually the objective is to determine a single
best player.  The organizers of the Math for Computer Science
tournament want to do more: they want to find a linear ranking of all
the players.  To avoid controversy, they want to avoid the awkward
situation of having a sequence of players each of whom beats the next
player in the sequence and then having last player beat the first.  So
the organizers will keep a running record of who beat whom during the
tournament, and they never allow simultaneous matches whose outcomes
could lead to an awkward situation.

Knowledge of binary relations can help the organizers in arranging the
tournament.  Namely, at any stage of the tournament, the organizers
have a record of who lost to whom.  Mathematically, we can say that
there is a binary relation $L$ on players where $p\mrel{L}q$ means
that player $p$ lost a match to player $q$.  No awkward situations
means that the positive length walk relation $L^+$ is a strict
partial order.
%
Indicate which of the following partial order concepts
correspond to the properties~\eqref{unbeat}--\eqref{noloseself} of the
partial order $L^+$. (Part~\eqref{min_matches} asks for a numerical answer, not a fill-in-the-blank.)
