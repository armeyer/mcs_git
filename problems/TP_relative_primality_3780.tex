\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Relative Primality

How many numbers between 1 and 3780 (inclusive) are relatively prime
to 3780?

\begin{solution}

864.

$3780 = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5 * 7$, so using the
formula for Euler's phi function, there are 
$\phi(3780)=(4-2) * (27-9) * (5-1)
* (7-1) = 864$ such numbers.
\end{solution}
