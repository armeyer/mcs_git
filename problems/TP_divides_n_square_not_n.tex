\begin{problem}
Give an example of two distinct positive integers $m,n$ such that
$n^2$ is a multiple of $m$, but $n$ is not a multiple of $m$.  How
about having $m$ be less than $n$?

\begin{solution}
The simplest initial example is $m = 2^3$, $n = 2^2$.  In this case
$m$ is not less than $n$, but that's easy to remedy: multiply $n$ by
3.  That is, let $m = 2^3$, $n = 3\cdot 2^2$.
\end{solution}
