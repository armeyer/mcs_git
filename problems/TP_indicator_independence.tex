\ppart\label{AindBindbarB} Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then so are
$A$ and $\setcomp{B}$.
\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
\pr{A \intersect \setcomp{B}}
  &  = \pr{A} - \pr{A \intersect B}
       & \text{(difference rule)}\\
  & =  \pr{A} - \pr{A} \cdot \pr{B}
       & \text{(independence of $A$ and $B$)}\\
  & =  \pr{A} (1 - \pr{B})\\
  & =  \pr{A} \cdot \pr{\setcomp{B}}. & \text{(complement rule)}
\end{align*}

%\ppart
Let $I_A$ and $I_B$ be the indicator variables for events $A$ and $B$.
Prove that $I_A$ and $I_B$ are independent iff $A$ and $B$ are
independent.  

\hint Let $A^1 \eqdef A$ and $A^0 \eqdef \setcomp{A}$, so the event
$[I_A = c]$ is the same as $A^c$ for $c \in \set{0,1}$; likewise for
$B^1, B^0$.

\begin{staffnotes}
Emphasize that independence is defined differently for events and for
RV's.  So a proof is required to confirm that the two defs agree when
the RV's are indicator variables.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}

\begin{staffnotes}
The first part below was proved in an earlier class problem.
\end{staffnotes}

First, we prove that if $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then so are
$A$ and $\setcomp{B}$. This follows since:
\begin{align*}
\pr{A \intersect \setcomp{B}}
  &  = \pr{A} - \pr{A \intersect B}
       & \text{(difference rule)}\\
  & =  \pr{A} - \pr{A} \cdot \pr{B}
       & \text{(independence of $A$ and $B$)}\\
  & =  \pr{A} (1 - \pr{B})\\
  & =  \pr{A} \cdot \pr{\setcomp{B}}. & \text{(complement rule)}
\end{align*}
Similarly, we can show that $\setcomp{A}$ and $B$ are independent, and
$\setcomp{A}$ and $\setcomp{B}$ are independent.  We conclude that $A$
and $B$ are independent iff $A^c$ and $B^d$ are independent for all
$c,d\in \set{0,1}$.

So the following propositions are equivalent:
\begin{align}
A\text{ and } B & \text{ are independent}.\notag\\
%\item $\exists c,d \in \set{0,1}$. \ [$A^c$ and $B^d$ are independent],
\forall c,d \in \set{0,1}. & [\text{$A^c$ and $B^d$ are independent}].\notag\\
\forall c,d \in \set{0,1}. & [\text{$[I_A = c]$ and $[I_A = d]$ are independent events}].\label{cd01}
\end{align}
But~\eqref{cd01} is exactly the definition of independence for the
random variables $I_A$ and $I_B$.
\end{solution}
