\begin{problem}
Explain where the following proof goes wrong.
\begin{falsethm*}
Every positive integer can be described in fewer than
fourteen words.
\end{falsethm*}

\begin{bogusproof}
  Let $S$ be the set of all numbers that cannot be so described. If $S
  \neq \emptyset$, it contains a least element by the Well Ordering
  Principle.  This element is ``the smallest number that cannot be
  described in less than fourteen English words.''  But the quoted phrase
  is a thirteen-word description of this number, a contradiction.  Thus $S$ must be
  empty, implying the theorem.
\end{bogusproof}
