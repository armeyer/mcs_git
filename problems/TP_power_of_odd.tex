\begin{problem}
Prove that for any $n > 0$, if $a^n$ is even, then $a$ is even.

\hint Contradiction.

\begin{solution}
  It's a familiar (and easily verified\footnote{Two odd integers
  can be written as $2x+1$ and $2y+1$ for some integers $x$ and $y$.  Then
  their product is also odd because it equals $2z +1$ where $z=
  2(2xy+x+y)+1$.}) fact that the product of two odd numbers is odd, from
which it follows that the product of \emph{any} finite number of odd
numbers is odd.

This means that, that if $a$ is odd, then $a^n$ would also be odd,
contradicting the fact that $a^n$ is even.

\end{solution}
