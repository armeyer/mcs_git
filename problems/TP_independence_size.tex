\begin{problem}
What is the smallest size sample space in which there are two
independent events, neither of which has probability zero or
probability one?  Explain.

\begin{solution}
The smallest such sample has four elements.  If
$\sspace=\set{1,2,3,4}$ has uniform probabilities, then $\set{1,2},
\set{1,3}$ are examples of independent events, each with probability
$1/2$.

To rule out sizes less than four:
\begin{itemize}

\item in a space of size one, there are no events with non-zero non-one probability,

\item in a space of size two, only a one-element event and its
  complement have non-zero non-one probability, and these are
  obviously not independent.

\item in a space of size three, the 1-outcome events are
  disjoint, so are not pairwise independent.  The remaining non-zero,
  non-one events are the three 2-outcome events.  These are not
  independent of any of the 1-outcome events since they contain, or
  are disjoint from, the 1-outcome events.

  Now suppose the three outcomes probabilities are $a, b, c > 0$,
  where $a+b+c=1$.  The 2-outcome events have probabilities $a+b, a+c,
  b+c$.  For two of these to be independent, we would need the
  probability of the intersection---a 1-outcome event---to be the
  product of their probabilities.  For example, we would need
\begin{equation}\label{abxaca}
(a+b)(a+c) = a
\end{equation}
But from~\eqref{abxaca} we get
\begin{align*}
(1 - c) (a +c) & = a,\\
a - ac + c(1-c) & = a,\\
c(1-c) & = ac,\\
(1-c) & = a,\\
1-(a + c)& = 0,\\
b &= 0,
\end{align*}
contradicting the fact that $b>0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}
