%Problem 1
\begin{problem}{20}

We define the following recurrence for $n \geq 0$: 

$$T_{n+2} = T_{n+1} + 2T_{n}$$

where $T_0 = T_1 = 1$.

\bparts
	\ppart{8} Prove by induction that $T_n$ is odd for $n \geq 0$.  You do not need to solve the recurrence for this.
	\solution{We use induction on $n$.  Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that $T_n$ is odd. 

\noindent \textit{Base case:} $P(0)$ is true because $T_0 =1$, an odd number. 

\noindent \textit{Inductive step:} Assum that $ P(n)$ is true where $n \geq 0$; that is, $T_n$ is odd.  We must show that $T_{n+1}$ is odd. But we know that $T_{n+1} = T_{n} + 2T_{n-1}$. And by our induction hypothesis $P(n)$ is true, so $T_{n}$ is odd. But we now have that $T_{n+1}$ is a sum of an odd number, $T_{n}$ and an even number $2T_{n-1}$, and thus must be odd as well.

The theorem follows by induction.}

	\newpage
	
	\ppart{12} Prove by induction that $\gcd(T_{n+1}, T_{n}) = 1$ for $n \geq 0$.  You may assume that $T_n$ is odd for all $n$.  You do not need to solve the recurrence for this.
	\solution{We use induction on $n$.  Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that $\gcd(T_{n+1}, T_{n}) = 1$.

\noindent \textit{Base case:} $P(0)$ is true because $T_0 = 1$ and $T_1 = 1$
are relatively prime.

\noindent \textit{Inductive step:} Assume that $P(n)$ is true where $n
\geq 0$; that is, $\gcd(T_{n+1}, T_{n})=1 $.  We must
show that $\gcd(T_{n+2}, T_{n+1})=1 $. Assume not, then $T_{n+2}$ and $T_{n+1}$  have a common divisor $d > 1$. That is $d|T_{n+2}$ and $d|T_{n+1}$. Since all $T_n$ are odd, we know that $d$ cannot be even. But then $d$ must also divide the linear combination $\frac{T_{n+2} -T_{n+1}}{2} = T_n$, showing that $gcd(T_{n+1},T_{n})=d$, contradicting the assumption that $T_n$ and $T_{n+1}$ are relatively prime.  So $\gcd(T_{n+2}, T_{n+1})=1$, as desired.

The theorem follows by induction.}

%Problem 2
\begin{problem}{12}

Find a closed-form solution to the following recurrence: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_0 &=& 4  \\
x_1 &=& 23  \\
x_n &=& 11x_{n-1} - 30x_{n-2} \text{ for } n \geq 2.
\end{eqnarray*}
\solution{The characteristic equation is $r^2 - 11r -30 = 0$.

Factoring this out we get $(r-5)(r-6)$, so our roots are
\begin{align*}
r_1 & = 5 \\
r_2 & = 6 \\
\end{align*}
Therefore a general form for a solution is
\[
x_n = A (5)^n + B (6)^n
\]
Substituting the initial conditions into this general form gives a
system of linear equations.
\begin{eqnarray*}
4 & = & A + B \\
23 & = & 5A + 6B
\end{eqnarray*}

The solution to this linear system is $A = 1$ and $B = 3$.  The complete solution to the recurrence is therefore
\[
x_n  =  5^n+3*6^n
\]

\ppart{5}
A balanced hand is one in which a player has roughly the same number of cards in each suit. How many different hands are there where the player has $4$ cards in one suit and $3$ cards in each of the other suits?
\solution{
There are $4$ suits to pick from for the longest suit, $4$ cards out of $13$ to choose from in that suit, and $3$ cards out of $13$ to choose from in each of the remaining $3$ suits.
This gives
\[4\cdot\binom{13}{4}\cdot\binom{13}{3} \cdot\binom{13}{3}\cdot\binom{13}{3}\]
such hands.}
\vspace{4 in}

\ppart{5}
Not surprisingly, a non-balanced hand is one in which a player has more cards in some suits than others. Hands that are very desired are ones where over half the cards are in one suit. How many different hands are there where there are exactly $7$ cards in one suit?
\solution{
There are $4$ suits to choose from for the long suit, $7$ cards out of $13$ to choose in that suit, and $6$ cards out of the remaining $39$ in the other $3$ suits. This gives
\[4\cdot\binom{13}{7}\cdot\binom{39}{6}\]
such hands.

Three pairs of twins are sharing a bucket of 24 pieces of chicken from Olive Oyl's.  Through the magic of twinship, each person always eats exactly as many pieces of chicken as his or her twin.  If each person eats at least one piece of chicken, how many ways can the chicken pieces be distributed amongst this family?

What is the probability that your coloring is a valid $2$-coloring of $G$? (Hint: the answer does not depend on the number of edges.)
\solution{ There are $2$ ways to correctly color each component, and there are $k$ components, so there is $2^k$ valid colorings. The number of colorings you might produce is $2^n$ and each is equallly likely. The probability that you get a valid coloring is

\begin{problem}{20}
In the far-off land of Spain, two soccer teams, Barcelona and Madrid have been battling each other for centuries to see who is more awesome. They play two games a year: one in the Spring and one in the Fall. The Madrid team has a tendency to fire their coaches very often to try to improve their results. The outcomes of the games are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If Madrid has not fired their coach since the previous game:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Barcelona wins with probability $\frac25$
\item
Madrid wins with probability $\frac25$
\item
They tie with probability $\frac15$
\end{itemize}
\item
If Madrid has fired their coach since the previous game (they haven't yet realized that it's a bad idea):
\begin{itemize}
\item
Barcelona wins with probability $\frac35$
\item
Madrid wins with probability $\frac15$
\item
They tie with probability $\frac15$
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Now, Madrid does not fire their coach if they win or tie, but if they lose, they will fire their coach with $90\%$ probability following the loss.
For the following two questions, assume that Madrid did not fire their coach before the Spring 2010 game.  Here, everything is mutually independent unless otherwise specified. You can use the following timeline to help you visualize the situation.

\begin{problem}{10}

An MIT student is walking along Mass Ave and is torn between making a trip to the pub and going to her dorm to finish her 6.042 homework.  The student is $n$ steps from the pub and $T-n$ steps from the dorm where $T >=3$ is the distance between the pub and the dorm, both located on Mass Ave (which we will assume to be a straight line).  The student flips a coin at each step to decide which way to go.  With probability $p$, the student takes $2$ steps toward the pub and with probability $1-p$, she takes 1 step toward her dorm.  If the student is one or two steps away from the pub and takes two steps toward the pub, then she reaches the pub.  If she is one step away from her dorm and takes a step toward her dorm, then she reaches the dorm..  Let $X_n$ be the probability that the student reaches the pub before she reaches the dorm.  Assume that all coin tosses are mutually independent.  Find a recurrence for $X_n$. (You do not need to solve the recurrence, but your answer should contain sufficient information such that a 6.042 could solve it given enough time.)
