$$\texttt{Q: } (\neg C \implies \neg A) \vee (\neg C \implies \neg B)$$ 

Use the truth table below to show whether $P$ and $Q$ are equivalent, $P \implies Q$, $Q \implies P$, or none of the above.

\[

Observe from the last two columns of the table that $P \implies Q$ is always true, but $Q \implies P$ is not always true (e.g. line $4$).  Thus $P$ and $Q$ are not equivalent but $P \implies Q$.

Let $G_0=1$, $G_1=2$, $G_2=4$, and define
\begin{equation}\label{Pn}
G_n =  G_{n-1} +2G_{n-2} + G_{n-3}

0$.

\solution{

The proof is by strong induction with hypothesis $P(n) := G_n\leq 3^n$.

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Base Cases}

\textbf{$n=0$:} $G_0 = 1 = 3^0$.

\textbf{$n=1$:} $G_1 = 2 < 3 = 3^1$.

\textbf{$n=2$:} $G_2 =f 4 < 9 < 3^2$.

\textbf{Inductive Step}:
Assume $n \geq 2$ and $P(k)$ for all $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$.
\begin{align*}
G_{n+1}
& = G_n +2G_{n-1} + G_{n-2} & \text{by~\eqref{Pn}}\\
& \leq 3^n + (2)3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} & \text{by induction hypothesis}\\
& = 3^{n-2} [3^2 + (2)3 + 1]\\
& = 3^{n-2} [(3 + 1)^2]\\
& = 3^{n-2} 4^2\\
& = 3^{n-2} 16\\
& < 3^{n-2} 27\\

%Taken from: http://www.cut-the-knot.org/ctk/invariant.shtml

In the game of Squares and Circles, the players (you and your computer) start with a sequence of shapes: some circles and some squares. On each move a player chooses any two shapes from the sequence. These two are replaced with a single one according to the following rule:

Identical shapes are replaced with a square. Different shapes are replaced with a circle.

At the end of the game, when only one shape remains, you are a winner if the remaining shape is a circle. Otherwise, your computer wins.

Find a number $x \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 112\}$ such that $18x \equiv 1 \pmod{113}$.

\solution[\vspace{4in}]{

We can do this using the pulverizer.  Specifically, if we find a pair $(s, t)$ such that $18s + 113t = 1$, then we know that $18s \equiv 1 \pmod{113}$.
\[
\begin{array}{ccccrcl}
x & \quad & y & \quad & \rem(x,y) & = & x - q \cdot y \\ \hline
113 && 18 && 5  & = &   113 - 6 \cdot 18 \\
18 && 5 && 3   & = &   18 - 3 \cdot 5 \\
&&&&            & = &   18 - 3 \cdot (113 - 6 \cdot 18) \\
&&&&            & = &   -1 \cdot 113 + 19 \cdot 18 \\
5 && 3  && 2   & = &   5 - 3 \\
&&&&						& = & (113 - 6 \cdot 18) - (-1 \cdot 113 + 19 \cdot 18) \\
&&&&            & = &   (2 \cdot 113 - 25 \cdot 18) \\
3 && 2 && 1 & = & 3 - 2 \\
&&&&            & = & (-1 \cdot 113 + 19 \cdot 18 ) - (2 \cdot 113 - 25 \cdot 18) \\
&&&&            & = &   \fbox{$-3 \cdot 113 + 44 \cdot 18$} \\
\end{array}
\]
So the multiplicative inverse of $18$ modulo $113$ is $44$.

\ppart{7}
Find a number $y \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 112\}$ such that $18^{112111} \equiv y \pmod{113}$
\hint{What power of $18$ is $x$ congruent to modulo $113$?}
\solution{By Fermat's Theorem, since $113$ is prime and $113$ and $18$ are relatively prime, it must be that
\[18\cdot 18^{111} \equiv 18^{113-1} \equiv 1 \pmod {113},\]
so $x \equiv 111 \pmod {113}$.
As a result,
\[18^{112111} \equiv 18^{112\cdot 1000 + 111} \equiv {18^{112}}^1000 \cdot 18^{111} \equiv 1^{1000} \cdot x \equiv x \equiv 44 \pmod {113},\]
so the answer is $44$.

\ppart{3}
Give a longest path on $G$.
\solution[\vspace{0.5in}]{
One possible solution is $(A, F, E, C, D, B)$.  This path has length equal to $|V|$ so it's a longest path.  (There are many possible solutions; just check that the solution is a path of length $6$.)

\ppart{3}
Give a coloring on $G$ and show that it uses the smallest possible number of colors.
\solution[\vspace{0.7in}]{
One possible $3$-coloring is: $A$, $D$, $E$ red; $B$, $F$ green; $C$ blue.  Because there exists an odd-length cycle (e.g. $B$, $D$, $C$), no $2$-coloring exists.  Therefore the given coloring uses the least possible number of colors.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% graph induction on edges
\newpage

\begin{problem}{20}
Let G be a graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and $k$ components. Prove that $G$ contains at least $m + k - n  = c$ cycles. (Hint: Prove this by induction on the number of edges, $m$)

\solution{
The proof is by induction on m with hypothesis P(n):= If G is a graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and $k$ components, then $G$ contains at least  $m + k -n = c$ cycles

\begin{proof}

\textbf{Base Case}
$m=0$: Let G be any graph with 0 edges and $n$ vertices. Then since there are no edges,  each vertex is its own connected component, hence there are $k=n$ connected components. Since there are no edges there are also no cycles so $c=0$. Lastly we note that $m+k-n=n+0-n=0$, and hence our base case. 

\textbf{Inductive Step}
Assume that P(m) holds, that is any graph with $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, and $k$ components has at least $m+k-n$ cycles. We must show that P(m+1) holds.

Consider an arbitrary graph $G$ with $m+1$ edges, $n$ vertices, and $k$ components. Suppose we remove an arbitrary edge, $e$, from $G$ to obtain $G'$. This edge, $e$, was either in a cycle in G or not:

\textit{Case 1:} $e$ is part of a cycle in $G$

If $e$ is in a cycle in $G$ then removing it removes at least one cycle. Furthermore, removing $e$ does not disconnect the graph so the number of components remains the same. So $G'$ has $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, and $k$ components, which by the inductive hypothesis tells us it has at least $m+k-n$ cycles. But $G$ has at least one more cycle than $G'$ (since $e$ is part of a cycle). So $G$ has at least $m+k-n +1$, or $(m+1)+k-n$ cycles, as desired.

\textit{Case 2:} $e$ is not part of a cycle in G
If $e$ is not part of a cycle removing it disconnects the graph of G, so the number of components in $G'$ is $k+1$. So, $G'$ contains $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, and $k+1$ components, so by the inductive hypothesis it contains at least $m+(k+1)-n$ cycles. Now since $e$ was not part of a cycle, $G$ and $G'$ have the same number of cycles. So $G$ also has at least$m+(k+1)-n$ cycles. Rearranging we get that $G$ has at least $(m+1)+k-n$ cycles as desired.
