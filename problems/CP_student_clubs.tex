\begin{problem}
A certain Institute of Technology has a lot of student clubs; these
are loosely overseen by the Student Association.  Each eligible club
would like to delegate one of its members to appeal to the Dean for
funding, but the Dean will not allow a student to be the delegate of
more than one club.  Fortunately, the Association VP took Math for
Computer Science and recognizes a matching problem when she sees one.

\bparts

\ppart Explain how to model the delegate selection problem as a
bipartite matching problem.  (This is a \emph{modeling problem}; we
aren't looking for a description of an algorithm to solve the
problem.)

\begin{solution}
Define a bipartite graph with the student clubs as one set of
vertices and everybody who belongs to some club as the other set of
vertices.  Let a club and a student be adjacent exactly when the student
belongs to the club.  Now a matching of clubs to students will give a
proper selection of delegates: every club will have a delegate, and every
delegate will represent exactly one club.
\end{solution}

\ppart The VP's records show that no student is a member of more than
9 clubs.  The VP also knows that to be eligible for support from the
Dean's office, a club must have at least 13 members.  That's enough
for her to guarantee there is a proper delegate selection.  Explain.
(If only the VP had taken an \emph{Algorithms} class, she could even
have found a delegate selection without much effort.)

\begin{solution}
The degree of every club is at least 13, and the degree of every
student is at most 9, so the graph is
\emph{degree-constrained}\inbook{
  (Definition~\bref{degree-constrained_def})}, which implies there
will be no bottlenecks to prevent a matching.  Hall's Theorem then
guarantees a matching.
\end{solution}
