\begin{problem}[4]
Use integration to find upper and lower bounds that differ by at most
0.1 for the following sum.  (You may need to add the first few terms
explicitly and then use integrals to bound the sum of the remaining
terms.)
%
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2i+1)^2}
\]

\begin{solution}
Let's first try standard bounds:
%
\[
\int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2x+3)^2}\ dx
\quad \leq \quad
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2i+1)^2}
\quad \leq \quad
\int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2x+1)^2}\ dx
\]
%
Evaluating the integrals gives:
%
\[
\left. -\frac{1}{2(2x+3)}\ \right|_0^{\infty}
\quad \leq \quad
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2i+1)^2}
\quad \leq \quad
\left. -\frac{1}{2 (2x+1)}\ \right|_0^{\infty}
\]
%
\[
\frac{1}{6}
\quad \leq \quad
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2i+1)^2}
\quad \leq \quad
\frac{1}{2}
\]
%
These bounds are too far apart, so let's sum the first couple terms
explicitly and bound the rest with integrals.
%
\[
\frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} + \int_2^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2x+3)^2}\ dx
\quad \leq \quad
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2i+1)^2}
\quad \leq \quad
\frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} + \int_2^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2x+1)^2}\ dx
\]
%
Integration now gives:
%
\[
\frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} +
    \left(\left. - \frac{1}{2 (2x+3)}\ \right|_2^{\infty}\right)
\quad \leq \quad
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2i+1)^2}
\quad \leq \quad
\frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} + 
    \left(\left. - \frac{1}{2 (2x+1)}\ \right|_2^{\infty}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} + \frac{1}{14}
\quad \leq \quad
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2i+1)^2}
\quad \leq \quad
\frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} + \frac{1}{10}
\]
%
Now we have bounds that differ by $1/10 - 1/14 < 1/10 = 0.1$.
\end{solution}
