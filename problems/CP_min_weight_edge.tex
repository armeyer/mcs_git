\begin{problem}

\iffalse
A \emph{weighted graph} is a graph with a function that assigns a
nonnegative real number to each edge.  The real number assigned to an
edge is called its \emph{weight}.  The weight of the graph is the sum
of the weights of its edges.

A \emph{minimum weight spanning tree} of a weighted graph is a
spanning tree with the smallest weight of any spanning tree of the
graph.

An example would be nice.
\end{editingnotes}

Let $G$ be a weighted graph and suppose there is a unique edge $e \in
\edges{G}$ with smallest weight, that is, $w(e) < w(f)$ for all edges
$f \in \edges{G} - \set{e}$.  Prove that any minimum weight spanning
tree (MST) of $G$ must include $e$.

\begin{solution}
First proof by citing the text:

\begin{proof}

According to the Gray Edge Lemma~\bref{lem:necessary-gray}, a minimum
weight edge among the gray edges of a solid coloring must be an edge
of \emph{every} MST.  So use any black/white coloring in which the
endpoints of $e$ are different colors; this makes $e$ a gray edge.
Since $e$'s weight is smaller than all other weights, it must be a
min-weight gray edge in this coloring.

Technically the Gray Edge Lemma only applies to graphs with no
same-weight edges, but as remarked in the text, we could apply it to
graphs with same-weight edges by assigning an arbitrary rank to
same-weight edges, and then treat higher rank vertices as having
larger weight among the edges with the same weight.

Since $e$ has min-weight with no ties, it will be in every MST for
each such ranking, and therefore in all MST's with same-weights
allowed.
\end{proof}

A Second proof mimics the proof of the Gray Edge Swap
Lemma~\bref{lem;gray-swap}:

\begin{proof}
Suppose to the contrary that $e$ is not included in some MST $T$.
Since $T$ is a spanning tree, if we add $e$ to $T$, everything stays
connected, so the new graph $T+e$ is a connected spanning subgraph.
Moreover, $T+e$ now has too many edges to be a tree, so the edge $e$
must be on a cycle in $T+e$.

Let $f$ be another edge on this cycle.  Now remove $f$ to obtain the
graph $(T + e) - f$.  Then
\begin{enumerate}

\item $(T + e) - f$ is still a connected spanning subgraph of $G$,
  because removing an edge $f$ on a cycle does not change
  connectedness.

\item $(T + e) - f$ is a tree, because it is a connected subgraph with
  the same number of vertices and edges as the tree $T$.

\item $w((T + e) - f) = w(T) - (w(f) - w(e)) < w(T)$.

\end{enumerate}

Hence $(T+e)-f$ is a spanning tree of $G$ with strictly smaller weight
than the MST $T$, contradicting the minimality of $T$.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}
