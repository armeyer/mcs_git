\begin{problem}

Suppose you want to select $k$ out of $n$ books on a shelf so that
there are always at least 4 unselected books between selected books.
Describe a  bijection between book selection and bit strings of length L 
containing exactly M 1s, so that counting the number of all such bit strings 
gives us the number of book selections. Find L and M and briefly explain why it works.

 
(Assume $n$ is large enough for this to be possible.)


\begin{solution}
%\[
%\binom{n-4(k-1)}{k}
%\]
%for $n \geq 5k-3$.
\[
L = n-4(k-1),\ M = k
\]

A selection of $k$ among $n$ books on a shelf corresponds in
  an obvious way to an $n$-bit string with exactly $k$ \STR{1}'s.

  So the problem reduces to finding a bijection between $n$-bit strings
  with $k$ \STR{1}'s that are at least 4 apart, and $(n-4(k-1))$-bit
  strings with $k$ \STR{1}'s.

  But in a string $s$ with $k$ \STR{1}'s that are at least 4 apart,
  all but the last \STR{1} must have a \STR{0000} to its right.  So we
  can map $s$ to a string with $k$ \STR{1}'s and $4(k-1)$
  fewer \STR{0}'s by erasing the \STR{0000}'s immediately to the right
  of each of the first $k-1$ \STR{1}'s.

  This map is a bijection because given any $(n-4(k-1))$-bit string with
  $k$ \STR{1}'s, there is a unique $n$-bit string with \STR{1}'s that
  are at least 4 apart that maps to it, namely, the string obtained by
  replacing each of the first $k-1$ \STR{1}'s in the $(n-4(k-1))$-bit
  string by a \STR{10000}.
\end{solution}
