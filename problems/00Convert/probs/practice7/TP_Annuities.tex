\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Annuities

Assuming you could be sure of getting a 4\% return forever on money
you invest, what would be a proper price to pay for an annuity that
paid you \$10,000 a year forever starting a year from now?

% Answer without commas or dollar signs. For example, if you want to
% enter \$140,000, you should type

% \begin{equation*}
% 140000
% 
% \end{equation*}

\begin{solution}
250000

The current value of \$10,000 paid out $i$ years from now is
$10,000/(1.04)^{i}$.  Summing this for $i=1,2,\dots$ we get
\$250,000.

Alternatively, \$250,000 put in the bank today, will allow us to
collect $0.04(\$250,000) = \$10,000$ every year, starting a year from
now.
\end{solution}
