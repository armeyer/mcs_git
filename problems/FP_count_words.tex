\begin{problem}
Let $r$ be the probability that a random permutation of the successive
letters in the word `TOOHOTTOHOOT' leaves the word unchanged.  Express
$r$ as a quotient of a multinomial coefficient and/or factorials.

\begin{solution}
There are $12!$ permutations of the 12 letters.  There are $6!$ perms
of O's, $4!$ perms of T's and 2 perms of H's, so the probability is
\[
r = \frac{6!\, 4!\, 2}{12!}.
\]
Alternatively, there are
\[
\binom{12}{6, 4, 2}
\]
distinguishable permutations of the 12 letters.  Each is equally
likely and only one is the original `TOOHOTTOHOOT,' so the probability is
\[
r = \frac{1}{\binom{12}{6, 4, 2}}
\]
\end{solution}
