\begin{problem}

Let $X$ be the six element set $\set{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4},
  x_{5}, x_{6}}$.

\bparts

\ppart 
How many subsets of $X$ contain $x_{1}$?

\begin{solution}
$2^5$.

We showed previously that there is a bijection between the subsets of
$X$ and binary strings of length~6. In the binary string, one of the
positions is now fixed---namely, the first position must be~1, since
we're only interested in subsets that have~$x_{1}$.  We still have 2
choices for all the other positions and by the product rule, we get
that the number of subsets is~$2^5$.
\end{solution}

\ppart 
How many subsets of $X$ contain $x_{2}$ and $x_{3}$ but do not
contain~$x_{6}$?

\begin{solution}
$2^3$.

Same logic---a bijection between the answer to this question and the
number of binary strings of length~6 with 3~positions fixed.  There are
$2^3$ subsets.
\end{solution}
