\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Unbiased Gambler's Ruin

\bparts

\ppart

In the unbiased Gambler's Ruin game, if the Gambler's initial capital
is \$40, what is the probability that his capital at some point grows
to be \$100?

\begin{solution}
2/5

This is the quotient of capital and goal amount, namely,
$40/100$.
\end{solution}

\ppart

What is the expected total number of bets in the game (how many bets will the gambler make before he has lost everything)?

\begin{solution}
2400

The intended profit is $100-40 = 60$, so the expected number of bets
is $40 \cdot 60$.
\end{solution}
