\subsection*{Arrow properties on a binary relation $R: A \rightarrow B$}
\begin{description}
\item[A function]

$R$ is a \term{function} when it has $[ \leq$ 1 arrow \textbf{out}$]$ property. In terms of a bipartite graph $G$ for the relation, every node on the left is incident to at most one edge.

\item[Surjective]

$R$ is \term{surjective} when it has the  $[ \geq$ 1 arrow \textbf{in}$]$ property.
That is, every point in the righthand, codomain column has at least one arrow pointing to it or in terms of a bipartite graph, $every$ node on the right is incident to at least one edge.

\item[Total]

$R$ is \term{total} when it has $[ \geq$ 1 arrow \textbf{out}$]$ property. $Every$ node on the left is incident to $at$ $least$ one edge.

\item[Injective]

$R$ is \term{injective} when it has $[ \leq$ 1 arrow \textbf{in}$]$ property. That is, every element of the codomain is mapped to by $at\text{ }most$ one element of the domain and $every$ node on the right is incident to at most one edge.

\item[Bijective]

$R$ is \term{bijective} when it has both the [= 1 arrow \textbf{out}] and the [= 1 arrow \textbf{in}] property.
\item[Surjection]
A surjective function is a \term{surjection}
\item[Injection]
An injective function is an \term{injection}.
\item[Bijection]
An injective surjective function is a \term{bijection}
