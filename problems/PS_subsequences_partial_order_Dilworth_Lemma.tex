\begin{problem}
Let $S$ be a sequence of $n$ different numbers.  A \emph{subsequence} of
$S$ is a sequence that can be obtained by deleting elements of $S$.

For example, if $S$ is
\[
(6,4,7,9,1,2,5,3,8),
\]
then $647$ and $7253$ are both subsequences of $S$ (for readability, we
have dropped the parentheses and commas in sequences, so $647$ abbreviates
$(6,4,7)$, for example).

An \emph{increasing subsequence} of $S$ is a subsequence of whose
successive elements get larger.  For example, $1238$ is an increasing
subsequence of $S$.  Decreasing subsequences are defined similarly; $641$
is a decreasing subsequence of $S$.

\begin{problemparts}

\problempart  
List all the maximum-length increasing subsequences of $S$, and all
the maximum-length decreasing subsequences.

\begin{solution}
The maximum-length increasing subsequences are $1238$ and
$1258$.  The maximum-length decreasing subsequences are
\[
641, 642, 643, 653, 753, 953
\]
\end{solution}

\end{problemparts}

Now let $A$ be the \emph{set} of numbers in $S$.  (So $A$ is the
integers $\Zintvcc{1}{9}$ for the example above.)  There are two
straightforward linear orders for $A$.  The first is numerical order
where $A$ is ordered by the $<$ relation.  The second is to order the
elements by which comes first in $S$; call this order $<_S$.  So for
the example above, we would have
\[
6 <_S 4 <_S 7 <_S 9 <_S 1 <_S 2 <_S 5 <_S 3 <_S 8
\]

\iffalse
letting $a_i$ be the $i$th element of $S$, we order $A$ with the linear
order $<_S$, where
\[
a_i <_S a_j \iff i < j.
\]
\fi

Let $\prec$ be the product relation of the linear orders $<_s$ and
$<$.  That is, $\prec$ is defined by the rule
\[
a \prec a' \quad \eqdef \quad a  < a' \QAND\ a <_S a'.
\]
So $\prec$ is a partial order on $A$ (Section~\bref{prodsec}).

\begin{problemparts}

\problempart Draw a diagram of the partial order $\prec$ on $A$.
What are the maximal and minimal elements?

\begin{solution}
The partial order $\prec$ is the positive path relation of the digraph
shown in Figure~\ref{precpathpic}.  The maximal elements are 8 and 9;
the minimal are 1, 4, and 6.

\end{figure}

\end{solution}

\problempart
Explain the connection between increasing and decreasing
subsequences of $S$, and chains and anti-chains under $\prec$.

\begin{solution}
A \emph{chain}, with its elements listed in numerically
increasing order, is an \emph{increasing} subsequence and an
\emph{antichain}, with its elements listed in numerically decreasing
order, is a \emph{decreasing} subsequence.
\end{solution}

\problempart 
Prove that every sequence $S$ of length $n$ has an increasing
subsequence of length greater than $\sqrt{n}$ or a decreasing subsequence
of length at least $\sqrt{n}$.

\begin{solution}
By Dilworth's Lemma, either a chain or an antichain must have
size at least $\sqrt{n}$, which, by the previous problem part, means there
is either an increasing or a decreasing subsequence of this size.  
\end{solution}

longest increasing and the longest decreasing subsequence in any given
sequence of integers.  (There is a nice one.)
