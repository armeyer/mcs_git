ps9 notes
ps9new: 
(4) Omit this one, proof requires stuff not covered in class (!)
unless the wording is changed to reflect that we're not proving a mapping exists, just that the numbers don't make it impossible?  seems weird though.
1. pidgeonhole
2. incl/excl
3. bijections, incl/excl, subset rule
5. combinatorial pf
6. counting
7. counting, incl/excl
9. pidgeonhole, basically
10. more counting, prod rule, incl/excl

other potential topics:
subset split rule / multinomial coefficients?
make a problem using this (see lecture notes for ideas) or find one in an old pset.

NOTES FROM MTG 10/28

3: need to explain how cards work; i.e. refer them to the txtbk.
4 out
9 out
12 out, too hard.
10: could extract for final

include:
1: 10pts
2: 10pt
3. select some subprobs, add some from later questions also (in particular prob 7 and 8).  add card deck explanation.  add parts from 10?  but this problem is kind of self-contained.  also 11 c and d.  // for this one, pick 10 subparts.  also leave some remaining (new) problem parts to put together a final exam question.
5: 15pt
6: 15pt

Martyna recommends:
3d, 3e, 3a, 7b, 11c, 11d and some of the graph problems (3g-3j)

1st lecture: 
all different kinds of mappings.  define {bijection, inj/surjection, counting}.  pidgeonhole principle.  _maybe_ incl/exclusion if time.
mappings, prod. rule, sum rule for disjoint sets.

2nd lecture:
inclusion/exclusion.
combinatorial proofs.
binomial.


RECITATIONS:
we have 3 old recitation problem sets, need to combine into 2.  can have 4 problems on each, there won't be time in class but they can at least have the solns for review later.
 
1st recitation: bookkeeper rule, then pidgeonhole principle, then counting probs at end.

2nd recitation: incl/excl, comb. pf.
