\begin{problem}
Use the \idx{Pulverizer} to find the inverse of 13 modulo 23 in the
range $\set{1,\dots,22}$.  % Show your work.

\begin{solution}
We first use the Pulverizer to find $s,t$ such that $\gcd(23,13) = s\cdot 23 +
t\cdot 13$, namely,
\[
1 = 4 \cdot 23 - 7 \cdot 13.
\]
This implies that $-7$ is an inverse of 13 modulo 23.

Here is the Pulverizer calculation:
\[
\begin{array}{ccccrcl}
x & \quad & y & \quad & \rem{x}{y} & = & x - q \cdot y \\ \hline
23 && 13 && 10  & = &   23 - 13 \\
13 && 10 && 3   & = &   13 - 10 \\
&&&&            & = &   13 - (23 - 13)\\
&&&&            & = &  (-1)\cdot 23 + 2 \cdot 13\\
10 && 3  && 1   & = &   10 - 3 \cdot 3 \\
&&&&            & = &   (23 - 13) - 3 \cdot ((-1)\cdot 23 + 2 \cdot 13))\\
&&&&            & = &   \fbox{$4 \cdot 23 - 7 \cdot 13$} \\
3  && 1  && 0   & = &
\end{array}
\]

To get an inverse in the specified range, simply find
$\rem{-7}{23}$, namely \textbf{16}.

\end{solution}
