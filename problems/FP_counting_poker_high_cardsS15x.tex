\begin{problem}
In a standard 52-card deck (13 ranks and 4 suits),
a hand is a 5-card subset of the set of 52 cards.
Express the answer to each part as a formula using
factorial, binomial, or multinomial notation.

\bparts

\ppart
Let $H$ be the set of all hands.

What is $\card{H}$?\hfill\examrule[1.0in]
\begin{solution}
$\card{H} = \binom{52}{5}$
\end{solution}

\examspace[0.2in]

\ppart
Let $H_{NP}$ be the set of all hands that include no pairs;
that is, no two cards in the hand have the same rank.

What is $\card{H_{NP}}$?  \hfill\examrule[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
$\card{H_{NP}} = \binom{13}{5} \binom{4}{1}^5$
\end{solution}

\examspace[0.2in]

\ppart Let $H_{S}$ be the set of all hands that are straights,
i.e. the ranks of the five cards are consecutive.  The order of the
ranks is $(A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,k,A)$; note that $A$ appears
twice.

What is $\card{H_{S}}$?\hfill\examrule[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
$\card{H_{S}} = \binom{10}{1} \binom{4}{1}^5$
\end{solution}
