\begin{problem}
Prove that whatever the marriage preferences among the men and women,
every man is the pessimal husband of his optimal wife.

\hint Follows directly from the definition of ``rogue couple.''

\begin{solution}
Paraphrased from the proof of Theorem~\bref{boyopt} of the text:

Suppose Alice is Bob's optimal wife.  Then if Alice was married to a
husband she liked less than Bob, she and Bob would be a rogue couple.
So Bob must be Alice's least preferred feasible husband, that is, her
pessimal husband.
\end{solution}

\begin{staffnotes}
Conversely, in a stable set of marriages, every man is the optimal
husband of his pessimal wife.

Is there a direct proof that does not rely on
Problem~\bref{PS_stable_marriage_better_worse_count}?
