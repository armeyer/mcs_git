\bparts

\ppart For each row in the following table, indicate whether the binary relation $aRb$ on the set $A$ is a weak partial order or a total order by filling in the appropriate entries with either Y = YES or  N = NO. 
In addition, list the minimal and maximal elements for each relation. 

\renewcommand\arraystretch{5}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}} | c | c | c | c | c | c |}
    \hline
    {\bf $A$} & {\bf $aRb$} & {\bf weak partial order} & {\bf total order} & {\bf minimal(s)} & {\bf maximal(s)} \\ \hline \hline
    $\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{R}^+$ & $a | b$ & & & & \\ \hline
    $P(\{1, 2, 3\})$ & $a\subseteq b$ & & & &  \\ \hline
    $\mathbb{N} \cup \{i\}$ & $a> b$ & & & &  \\
