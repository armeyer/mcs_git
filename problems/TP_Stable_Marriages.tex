\begin{problem}
Three girls and three boys decide to get married to one another, and
each has a list of preferences:
           
Girls:
\begin{description}
\begin{tabular}{l c r}
\\ \textbf{A}shley,& with order of preference:& Z > X > Y

\\ \textbf{B}etty,& with order of preference:& Z > Y > X

\\ \textbf{C}athy,& with order of preference:& Y > Z > X
\end{tabular}
\end{description}
           
Boys:
\begin{description}     
\begin{tabular}{l c r}      
\\ \textbf{X}avier,& with order of preference:& B > C > A

\\ \textbf{Y}anos,& with order of preference:& A > C > B

\\ \textbf{Z}achary,& with order of preference:& B > A > C
\end{tabular}
\end{description}

You, as a marriage counselor, have to match them so that they can live
happily ever after---that is, find a set of marriages that is
\emph{stable}. What do you tell them to do?

% Type in your answer in the form (A X) (B Y) (C Z), wife followed by a
% husband.

\begin{solution}

$\set{A-X, B-Z, C-Y}$ or $\set{A-Y, B-Z, C-X}$.

$\set{A-X, B-Z, C-Y}$ is the matching that we get if we run the stable
  marriage algorithm using the girls as suitors; this is the
  girl-optimal solution.  If we run the algorithm using the boys as
  suitors, we get the matching $\set{A-Y, B-Z, C-X}$; this the boy-optimal
  solution.
\end{solution}
