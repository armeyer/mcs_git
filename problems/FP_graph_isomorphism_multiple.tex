\begin{problem} \mbox{}

\inbook{Indicate}\inhandout{Circle} the simple graph properties below
that are \textbf{preserved under isomorphism}.

\bparts


\ppart There is a cycle that includes all the vertices.

\ppart The vertices can be numbered 1 through $2^4$.

\ppart\label{eqlnth} Two edges are of equal length.

%\ppart The graph remains connected if any two edges are removed.

\ppart There exists an edge that is an edge of every spanning tree.

%\ppart The negation of a property that is preserved under isomorphism.

%\ppart There are exacty two spanning trees.

\ppart The $\QOR$ of two properties that are preserved under isomorphism.

%\ppart The graph remains connected if a vertex is removed.

\begin{solution}
All the properties except~\eqref{eqlnth} are preserved under
isomorphism.  Property~\eqref{eqlnth} applies to drawings of graphs,
not graphs themselves.  It doesn't make sense to say it is preserved
by isomorphism.
\end{solution}
