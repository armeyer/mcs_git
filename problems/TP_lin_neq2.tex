\begin{problem} \mbox{}

Let $a,b$ be positive integers.  Suppose no integer linear combination
of $a$ and $b$ equals two.  Explain why no integer linear
combination of $a^2$ and $b^2$ equals eight.

\inhandout{\hint Rephrase in terms of gcd.}

\begin{solution}
If no integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$ equals two, then there
can't be such a linear combinations that equals one (or else doubling
coefficients would yield a combination equal to two), so the all such
linear combinations are greater than or equal to least three.  Since
the $\gcd(a,b)$ is such a linear combination, it follows that
$\gcd(a,b) \geq 3$, and hence $\gcd(a^2,b^2) = \gcd(a,b)^2 \geq 3^2 =
9 > 8$.  Since $\gcd(a^2,b^2)$ divides every integer linear
combination of $a^2, b^2$, no such linear combination can equal eight.
\end{solution}
