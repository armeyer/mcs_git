\begin{problem}
``Token replacing'' is a single player game using a set of tokens,
  each colored black or white.  Except for color, the tokens are
  indistinguishable.  %The game starts with one black token.
  In each move, a player can replace one black token with two
  white tokens, or replace one white token with two black tokens.

% Zoran: I somehow prefer to introduce the start state here, as it may
% be hinting too much if introduced in part (b). Also, I came up
% with another part of the problem for which it may be better to
% have the start state fixed as part of rules.

  We can model this game as a state machine whose states are pairs
  $(n_b,n_w)$ where $n_b \geq 0$ equals the number of black tokens,
  and $n_w \geq 0$ equals the number of white tokens.
  
 Let us assume that the game starts with one black token, that is,
 state $(1,0)$.

Prove that the predicate $n_w - n_b  \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$
is true for all reachable states.

\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
The predicate is true for the start state since $n_w - n_b = -1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$.

Let $(n_b, n_w)$ be an arbitrary state for which $n_w - n_b \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$.
The only two possible transitions are into state $(n'_b, n'_w) = (n_b - 1, n_w + 2)$
or state $(n'_b, n'_w) = (n_b + 2, n_w - 1)$. Note that
$n'_w - n'_b = n_w - n_b \pm 3 \equiv n_w - n_b \pmod{3} \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$,
and thus the property is a preserved invariant.

Since the predicate is a preserved invariant and true for the start state,
it is true for all reachable states by the invariant principle.
\end{solution}

\ppart
Does the same hold for the predicate $n_b - n_w \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$? Explain.

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
No. This predicate is not true for the start state.
\end{solution}

\begin{claim*}
Every state $(n_b, n_w)$ such that $n_w - n_b \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ is reachable. %starting from state $(1, 0)$.
\end{claim*}
Prove the Claim \emph{by induction}.

\hint Let
\[
P(n) \eqdef \forall (n_b, n_w) \in \naturals^2.\,
 [(n_b + n_w = n) \QAND  (n_w - n_b \equiv 2 \pmod{3})]
     \QIMPLIES (n_b,n_w) \text{ is reachable}.
\]

\examspace[4.0in]

\begin{solution}
We prove the Claim by induction on $n$ with induction hypothesis $P$.

\inductioncase{Base case}: ($n = 1$). 
The only state that has $n_b + n_w = 1$ and satisfies the predicate is $(1, 0)$,
which is reachable as a start state.

\inductioncase{Base case}: ($n = 2$). 
The only possible states with $n=2$ are $(0, 2)$, $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 0)$,
out of which only $(2, 0)$ satisfied the predicate. $(0, 2)$ is reachable
from $(1, 0)$ by replacing a black token.

\inductioncase{Inductive step}:
Assume that the induction hypothesis holds for some $n \ge 2$. 
We need to show that for any state $(n_b, n_w) \in \naturals^2$
such that $n_b+n_w=n+1$ and $n_w-n_b \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$,
that state is reachable.

Let $(n_b, n_w)$ be an arbitrary such state. Then, either $n_b \ge 2$
or $n_w \ge 2$ must hold (easy to prove by contradiction).
Let us assume $n_b \ge 2$ holds.
Then, $(n'_b, n'_w) = (n_b-2, n_w+1)$ is a valid state ($\in \naturals^2$)
and satisfies  the predicate since $n'_w- n'_b = n_w+1 - (n_b-2) = n_w - n_b + 3 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$.
Therefore, $(n'_b, n'_w)$ is reachable by the induction hypothesis
and $(n_b, n_w)$ is reachable by a single transition from it.
Similar holds when $n_w \ge 2$.

We conclude that in any case $(n_b, n_w)$ is reachable, which completes
the induction step.

For each predicate above, how would you modify the game such that
it is true for all reachable states?

%\examspace[2.0in]

\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Change the rules such that each token is replace with 4 tokens of opposite color instead.
\item No change.
\item Start with any state for which this predicate is satisfied, e.g., $(0, 1)$ or $(2, 0)$.
\item No change.
\item Start with any state for which $n_b + n_w > 5$, e.g., $(3, 3)$.
\item Change the rules such that each token is replace with 1 token of opposite color instead.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
