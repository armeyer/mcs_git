\begin{problem}
Show that $\log_{7} n$ is either an integer or irrational, where $n$ is a
positive integer.  Use whatever familiar facts about integers and primes
you need, but explicitly state such facts.  (This problem will be graded
on the clarity and simplicity of your proof.  If you can't figure out how
to prove it, ask the staff for help and they'll tell you how.)

\begin{solution}
  The statement to be proved is equivalent to the assertion that, for all
  positive integers, $n$, if $\log_7 n$ is rational, then it is an
  integer.  This is clearly true for $n=1$, since $\log_7 1$ is the
  integer zero.

Since $\log_7 x>0$ for $x > 1$, if $log_7 n$ not irrational, we would have
\begin{equation}\label{ij}
\log_7 n = \frac{i}{j}
\end{equation}
for some positive integers, $i,j$.

Now, raising $7$ to the power $\log_7 n$, we have from~\eqref{ij}
\[
n  = 7^{\log_7 n} = 7^{i/j}.
\]
Then, taking $j$th powers,
\begin{equation}\label{nj}
n^j =(7^{i/j})^j =  7^i.
\end{equation}
Since $i,j >0$, both sides of equation~\eqref{nj} are integers.  Also,
since the only prime dividing the righthand of~\eqref{nj} is 7,
\emph{the fact that integers factor uniquely into primes} implies that the
only prime factor of $n^j$, and hence the only prime factor of $n$, is 7.
This means that $n$ can only be a nonnegative power of 7, so $\log_7 n$
must be a nonnegative integer.
\end{solution}
\end{problem}
