\begin{problem}
Fermat's Little Theorem~\bref{fermat_little}\footnote{This Theorem is
  usually stated as
\[
 a^{p-1}\equiv 1\pmod{p},
\]
for all primes $p$ and integers $a$ not divisible by $p$.  This
follows immediately from~\eqref{apeqvap} by canceling $a$.}
asserts that
\begin{equation}\label{apeqvap}
  a^p\equiv a\pmod{p}
\end{equation}
for all primes $p$ and nonnegative integers $a$.  This is immediate
for $a=0,1$ so we assume that $a \geq 2$.

This problem offers a proof of~\eqref{apeqvap} by counting strings
over a fixed alphabet with $a$ characters.

\bparts

\ppart\label{countak} How many length-$k$ strings are there over an
$a$-character alphabet? \hfill\examrule
\begin{solution}
$a^k$.

For each index in the length-$k$ string, there are $a$ possible choices
for the character.  Since there are $k$ indices, there are a total of 
$a^k$ possible strings.
\end{solution}

\ppart How many of these strings use more than one character? \hfill\examrule
\begin{solution}
$a^k-a$.

For each of the $a$ characters, there is exactly one length-$k$
string using only that character.  Therefore, the number of 
length-$k$ strings that use more than one character is $a^k-a$
\end{solution}

Let $z$ be a length-$k$ string.  The \emph{length-$n$ rotation} of $z$
is the string $yx$, where $z = xy$ and the length $\lnth{x}$ of $x$
is $\rem{n}{k}$.

\bparts

\ppart\label{rotateagain} Verify that if $u$ is the length-$n$
rotation of $z$, and $v$ is the length-$m$ rotation of $u$, then $v$
is the length-($n+m$) rotation of $z$.

\begin{solution}
There are two cases we need to consider.

Case 1: [$\rem{n}{k} + \rem{m}{k} \le k$] Suppose $z = wxy$,
where $\lnth{w} = \rem{n}{k}$ and $\lnth{x} = \rem{m}{k}$.  Then $u = xyw$,
and so $v = ywx$. Therefore, $\lnth{wx} = \rem{n}{k} + \rem{m}{k}$, which
is equal to $\rem{(\remainder(n}{k)+\rem{m}{k}),k}$. But we know that
$\rem{n}{k} + \rem{m}{k} \le k$, so $\lnth{wx} = \rem{n+m}{k}$.
Thus, $v$ is the length-$n+m$ rotation of $z$.

Case 2: [$\rem{n}{k} + \rem{m}{k} > k$] Suppose $z = wxy$,
where $\lnth{wx} = \rem{n}{k}$ and $\lnth{yw} = \rem{m}{k}$. Then $u = ywx$,
and so $v = xyw$. But $\lnth{w} = \lnth{wx} + \lnth{yw} - \lnth{z} = \rem{n}{k} +
\rem{m}{k} + k$. Since $k < \rem{n}{k} + \rem{m}{k} \le 2k$, this means
$\lnth{w} = \rem{(\remainder(n}{k) + \rem{m}{k}),k} = \rem{n + m}{k}$.
Thus, $v$ is the length-$n+m$ rotation of $z$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Let $\approx$ be the ``is a rotation of'' relation on strings.
That is,
\[
v \approx z \quad \QIFF\quad \exists n \in \nngint.\, [v\ \text{is a length-$n$ rotation of}\ z].
\]
Prove that $\approx$ is an equivalence relation.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
Reflexivity follows since everything is a length 0 rotation of itself.
Symmetry follows because $v$ is a length $m$ rotation of $z$ iff $z$
is a length $\lnth{z} - \rem{m}{\lnth{z}}$ rotation of $v$.
Transitivity follows from part~\eqref{rotateagain}.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{xyyxm*} Prove that if $xy=yx$ then $x$ and $y$ each consist of
repetitions of some string $u$.  That is, if $xy=yx$, then $x,y \in
u^*$ for some string $u$.

\hint By induction on the length $\lnth{xy}$ of $xy$.

\begin{editingnotes}
(Old hint leading to more cumbersome proof: Let $u$ be the
  shortest positive length string such that $uy=yu$.)
\end{editingnotes}

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
By strong induction with the induction hypothesis
\[
P(n) \eqdef \forall \text{strings}\ x,y. \lnth{xy} = n
\QIMPLIES\ \exists u.\ x,y \in u^*.
\]

\inductioncase{Base case} ($n=0$).  Immediate.

\inductioncase{Induction step}.  Suppose $\lnth{xy} = n+1$ and
$xy=yx$.  We must now show that $x,y \in u^*$ for some string $u$.

Since $x$ and $y$ are interchangeable in the hypotheses, we may assume
that $\lnth{x} \leq \lnth{y}$.  If $\lnth{x} = 0$, then letting $u
\eqdef y$ yields $x,y\in u*$, so we may assume $\lnth{x} > 0$.

Now $xy=yx$ implies that $y = x y'$ for some string $y'$.  So we have
\[
x(xy')= xy = yx = (xy')x = x(y'x),
\]
and therefore
\[
xy' = y'x.
\]
Also $\lnth{xy'} < \lnth{xy}$.  By induction hypothesis, we have
\[
x,y' \in u^*
\]
for some string $u$.  Since $y = xy'$ is a concatenation of strings in
$u^*$, we conclude that $y\in u^*$.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}

\ppart\label{exactlyp} Conclude that if $p$ is prime and $z$ is a
length-$p$ string containing at least two different characters, then
$z$ is equivalent under $\approx$ to exactly $p$ strings (counting
itself).

\begin{solution}
By part~\eqref{xyyxm*}, $z \in u^*$ for some string $u$.  Letting $m$
be the length of the shortest such $u$, it follows that $z$ is
$\approx$-equivalent to exactly $m$ strings.  In particular,
$\lnth{z}$ is a multiple of $m$.

But $\lnth{z} = p$, so $m$ must be 1 or $p$, and since $z$ has at
least two different characters, $m \neq 1$.  So $z$ is equivalent to
exactly $p$ strings.
\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude from parts~\eqref{countak} and~\eqref{exactlyp} that
$p \divides (a^p -a$), which proves Fermat's Little
Theorem~\eqref{apeqvap}.

\begin{solution}
From part~\eqref{countak}, there are $a^p-a$ length-$p$ strings made
from an alphabet with $a$ characters that contain at least 2 different
characters.  From~\eqref{exactlyp}, a length-$p$ string of at least
two different characters is equivalent under $\approx$ to exactly $p$
other strings.  Partitioning the strings with two or more characters
into equivalence classes under $\approx$, it follows that each block
of the partition has $p$ elements, and therefore the total number of
strings is a multiple of $p$.  That is, $p \divides a^p-a$, and
therefore $a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$, as desired.
\end{solution}
