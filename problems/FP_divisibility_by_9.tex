\begin{problem}

Prove that for any positive integer, the difference between it and the
sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

\begin{solution}
Since $10 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$, we know that
\begin{equation}\label{10k}
10^k \equiv 1^k \equiv 1 \pmod{9}.
\end{equation}
Every positive has the form:
\[
d_k \cdot 10^k + d_{k-1} \cdot 10^{k-1} + \ldots + d_1 \cdot 10 + d_0.
\]

From~\eqref{10k}, we have
\begin{equation*}
d_k \cdot 10^k + d_{k-1} \cdot 10^{k-1} + \ldots + d_1 \cdot 10 + d_0
    \equiv d_k + d_{k-1} + \ldots + d_1 + d_0 \pmod{9} \\
\end{equation*}

This shows that the remainder when the original number is divided by 9 is equal
to the remainder when the sum of its digits is divided by 9. Therefore, the
difference between them must be divisible by 9.
\end{solution}
