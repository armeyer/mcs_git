\begin{problem}
If we raise an irrational number to an irrational power, can the result be
rational?  Show that it can by considering $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and
arguing by cases.

\begin{solution}
We want to find irrational numbers $a,b$ such that $a^b$ is rational.
We argue by cases.

Case 1: [$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational].  Let $a = b = \sqrt{2}$.  $a$
and $b$ are irrational since $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational as we know.  Also,
$a^b$ is rational by case hypothesis.  So we have found the required $a$
and $b$ in this case.

Case 2: [$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational].  Let $a =\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$
and $b = \sqrt{2}$.  Then $a$ is irrational by case hypothesis, we know
$b$ is irrational, and
\[
a^b = \paren{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}}^{\sqrt{2}} =
      \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2,
\]
which is rational.  So we have found the required $a$
and $b$ in this case also.

So in any case, there will be irrational $a,b$ such that $a^b$ is
rational.  Note that we have no clue about which case is true, but that
didn't matter.

\end{solution}
