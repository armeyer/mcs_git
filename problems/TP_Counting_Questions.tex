\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Counting Questions

Alice is thinking of a number between 1 and 1000.

 What is
the least number of yes/no questions you could ask her and be guaranteed to discover what it is? (Alice always answers truthfully.)

\begin{solution}

10.


The best you can do with a yes/no question is to halve the
space of remaining possibilities.  So,
starting with 1000 possibilities, the first question (``Is the number
greater than 500?'') can lead you to only 500 possibilities, the second
question can lead you to only 250, etc.  The smallest $n$ such that $2^n \geq 1000$ is $n=10$, so you will need 10 questions
(in the worst case).
