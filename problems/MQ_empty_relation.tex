\begin{problem}

Prove that for any nonempty set $D$, there is a unique binary relation
on $D$ that is both asymmetric and symmetric.

\begin{solution}
The unique relation is the \emph{empty relation} on $D$.  This
relation is vacuously asymmetric and symmetric, so it is only
necessary to prove uniqueness.

Now suppose $R$ is a nonempty relation, that is, $d \mrel{R} e$ for
some $d,e \in D$.  Then if $R$ is symmetric, we have also $e \mrel{R}
d$, which violates asymmetry.  So if $R$ is symmetric and asymmetric,
it must be empty.
\end{solution}
