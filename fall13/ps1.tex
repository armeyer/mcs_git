\textbf{Reminder}:

\begin{itemize}

\item Problems should be 
  \href{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/fall13/submission.shtml}
       {submitted electronically}, and each problem should have an attached
  \href{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/fall13/submission.shtml#collab-state}
       {\emph{collaboration statement}}.

\item The class has a
  \href{http://piazza.com/mit/fall2013/6042j18062j/home}{Piazza
    forum} structured to get you help fast and efficiently from
  classmates and staff.  With Piazza you may post questions---both
  administrative and content related---to the entire class or to just
  the staff.  You are likely to get faster response through Piazza
  than from direct email to staff.  Posting questions or comments to
  Piazza is optional.
