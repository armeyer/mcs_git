\begin{problem}
Suppose $B$ is an AVL tree of depth $d$, $S$ is an AVL tree of depth
$d+2$, and $N$ is a search tree with branches $B$ and $S$ as shown in
Figure~\ref{rotate3}.  Also, $S$ has as branches an AVL tree $R$ of
depth $d+1$ and an AVL tree $U$ with depth $d$, as shown.

\end{figure}                                                       

We define $R', N', S'$ to be new trees with
\begin{align*}
\nlbl{(R')} & = \nlbl{(R)}\\
\nlbl{(N')} & = \nlbl{(N)}\\
\nlbl{(S')} & = \nlbl{(S)},
\end{align*}
with branches as indicated in Figure~\ref{rotate4}.

Verify that $R'$ is an AVL tree and $\nlbls{(R')} = \nlbls{(N)}$.
