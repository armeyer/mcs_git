%% title: GCD's With Linear Combinations

Find integer coefficients, $x$, $y$, in a linear
combination $25x + 32y = \GCD(25, 32)$.

%Give your answer as a parenthesized pair of integers, for example, (1
%2).

\begin{solution}
$\GCD(25, 32) = 1 = 9 * 25 + (-7)*32$,
where these coefficients ($9$ and $-7$) were obtained by applying the
Pulverizer.

Any pair of the form ($9 + 32k$, $-7 - 25k$) would also be correct.
\end{solution}

What is the inverse ($\bmod 25$) of 32?

\begin{solution}

18

Since $1 = 9*25 + (-7)*32$, it follows that $-7$ is an inverse of 32
(mod 25), and therefore so is $\rem{-7}{25} = 18$.
