\begin{problem}
You want to choose a team of $m$ people for your startup company from
a pool of $n$ applicants, and from these $m$ people you want to choose
$k$ to be the team managers.  You took a Math for Computer Science
subject, so you know you can do this in
\[
\binom{n}{m}\binom{m}{k}
\]
ways.  But your CFO, who went to Harvard Business School, comes up with
the formula
\[
\binom{n}{k}\binom{n-k}{m-k}.
\]
Before doing the reasonable thing---dump on your CFO or Harvard
Business School---you decide to check his answer against yours.

\bparts

\ppart Give a \emph{\idx{combinatorial proof}} that your CFO's formula
agrees with yours.

\begin{solution}
Instead of choosing first $m$ from $n$ and then $k$ from the chosen
$m$, you could alternately choose the $k$ managers from the $n$ people
and then choose $m-k$ people to fill out the team from the remaining
$n-k$ people.  This gives you $\dbinom{n}{k} \dbinom{n-k}{m-k}$ ways
of picking your team.  Since you must have the same number of options
regardless of the order in which you choose to pick team members and
managers,
\[
\binom{n}{m} \binom{m}{k} = \binom{n}{k} \binom{n-k}{m-k}.
\]

Formally, in the first method we count the number of pairs $(A,B)$,
where $A$ is a size $m$ subset of the pool of $n$ applicants, and $B$
is a size $k$ subset of $A$.  By the Generalized Product Rule, there
are
\[
\binom{n}{m}\cdot \binom{m}{k}
\]
such pairs.

In the second method, we count pairs $(C,D)$, where $C$ is a size $k$
subset of the applicant pool, and $D$ is a size $(m-k)$ subset of the
pool that is disjoint from $C$.  By the Generalized Product Rule,
there are
\[
\binom{n}{k}\cdot \binom{n-k}{m-k}
\]
such pairs.

These two expressions are equal because there is a simple bijection
between the two kinds of pairs, namely map $(A,B)$ to $(B, A-B)$.
\end{solution}

the rest of the problems.

\ppart Verify this combinatorial proof by giving an \emph{algebraic}
proof of this same fact.

\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
\binom{n}{m}\binom{m}{k}
& = \frac{n!}{m! (n-m)!} \frac{m!}{k! (m-k)!} \\
& = \frac{n!}{(n-m)! k! (m-k)!} \\
& = \frac{n! (n-k)!}{(n-m)! k! (m-k)! (n-k)!} \\
& = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} \frac{(n-k)!}{(n-m)!(m-k)!} \\
& = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} \frac{(n-k)!}{((n-k) - (m-k))! (m-k)!} \\
& = \binom{n}{k}\binom{n-k}{m - k}.
\end{align*} 
\end{solution}
