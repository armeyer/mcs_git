\begin{problem}
Complete the proof of Lemma~\ref{to1_well-order} by showing that
the number $n_S+f_S$ is the minimum element in $S$.
\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}
Let $n+f$ be any number in $S$.  We will show that $n_S+f_S \leq n+f$,
which proves that $n_S+f_S$ is minimum.

To begin, we have $n_S \leq n$ by minimality of $n_S$.  Now there are
two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ($n_S = n$).  Then $f_S \leq f$ by minimality of $f_S$.
  Therefore, $n_S+f_S \leq n+f$.
\item ($n_S +1 \leq n$).  Since 1 is the largest element in $\twdone$ by
  definition, it follows that
\[
n_S + f_S \leq n_S + 1 \leq n \leq n+f.
\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{proof}

\end{solution}
