\begin{problem}
A 3-conjunctive normal form (3CNF) formula is a conjunctive normal
form (CNF) formula in which each \QOR-term is an \QOR\ of at most 3
\emph{literals} (variables or negations of variables).  Although it
may be hard to tell if a propositional formula $F$ is satisfiable, it
is always easy to construct a formula $\eqsat{F}$ that is
\begin{itemize}
\item a 3CNF,
\item has at most 24 times as many occurrences of variables as $F$, and
\item is satisfiable iff $F$ is satisfiable.
\end{itemize}

Note that we do \emph{not} expect $\eqsat{F}$ to be \emph{equivalent}
to $F$.  We do know how to convert any $F$ into an equivalent CNF
formula, and this equivalent CNF formula will certainly be satisfiable
iff $F$ is.  But in many cases, the smallest CNF formula equivalent to
$F$ may be \emph{exponentially larger} than $F$ instead of only 24
times larger.  Even worse, there may not be any \textbf{3}CNF
equivalent to $F$.

\begin{staffnotes}
For your information---not to show to students necessarily, an example
of this exponential blowup would be formulas of the form
\[
(P_1 \QAND Q_1) \QOR (P_2 \QAND Q_2) \QOR \cdots \QOR (P_n \QAND Q_n)
\]
whose CNF equivalents have more than $2^n$ occurrences of variables.
\end{staffnotes}

To construct $\eqsat{F}$, the idea is to introduce a different new
variable for each operator that occurs in $F$.  For example, if $F$
was
\begin{equation}\label{PXQXROPS}
((P \QXOR Q) \QXOR R) \QOR (\bar{P} \QAND S)
\end{equation}
we might use new variables $X_1$, $X_2$, $O$ and $A$ corresponding to
the operator occurrences as follows:
\[
((P \underbrace{\QXOR}_{X_1} Q) \underbrace{\QXOR}_{X_2} R) \underbrace{\QOR}_{O}
 (\bar{P} \underbrace{\QAND}_{A} S).
\]
Next we write a formula that constrains each new variable to have the
same truth value as the subformula determined by its corresponding
operator.  For the example above, these constraining formulas would be
\begin{align*}
X_1 &\QIFF (P \QXOR Q),\\
X_2 &\QIFF (X_1 \QXOR R),\\
A   &\QIFF (\bar{P} \QAND S),\\
O   & \QIFF (X_2 \QOR A)
\end{align*}

\ppart\label{Q4forms} Explain why the \QAND\ of the four constraining
formulas above along with a fifth formula consisting of just the
variable $O$ will be satisfiable iff~\eqref{PXQXROPS} is satisfiable.

\begin{solution}
All the propositions, if true, ensure that the value of the two sides
of the \QIFF\ are the same.  This means that we could substitute any
of the two sides for the other in another proposition and obtain the
same result.  This way, we can use the four constraining formulas to
build~\eqref{PXQXROPS} again, showing that the satisfiability
of~\eqref{PXQXROPS} implies the satisfiability of the four formulas
and $O$ and vice versa.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{3cf24} Explain why each constraining formula will be
equivalent to a 3CNF formula with at most 24 occurrences of variables.

\begin{solution}
Each constraining formula has only three occurrences of variables, so
its CNF will be the \QAND\ of at most 8 \QOR-terms, where each
\QOR-term is an \QOR\ of the 3 variables or their negations.
\end{solution}

\ppart Using the ideas illustrated in the previous parts, briefly
explain how to construct $\eqsat{F}$ for an arbitrary propositional
formula $F$. (No need to fill in all the details for this
part---a high-level description is fine.)

\begin{solution}
We start by using the technique shown to make a proposition for each
boolean operator.  As in part~\ref{Q4forms}, we can turn any of the
propositions we obtain into 3CNF formulas with at most 24 occurrences
of variables. Then, $C(F)$ is the AND of all these 3CNF propositions.
So, it is satisfiable whenever the original proposition is (see
part~\ref{Q4forms}), it is also of form 3CNF because it is an \QAND\ of
multiple 3CNF and it has, by part~\ref{3cf24}, at most 24 times as many
variable occurrences.
\end{solution}
