\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Relative Primality

How many numbers between 1 and 6042 (inclusive) are relatively prime
to 3780? Hint: $53$ is a factor.

\begin{solution}

864.

$3780 = 2 * 3 * 19 * 53$, so using the
formula for Euler's phi function, there are 
$\phi(3780)=(2-1) * (3-1) * (19-1) * (53-1) = 1872$ such numbers.
\end{solution}
