\ppart
For the planar embedding picture below, list all the discrete faces.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \graphic[height=1in]{planar_graph}
\end{figure}

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
  adea, abea, befb, bcfb, cfgc, abcgfeda
\end{solution}

\ppart
Provide a drawing of a different planar embedding of the graph 
above. Also list all the faces of the embedding.

\examspace[4in]

\begin{solution}
  The planar drawing below has the following faces:
  adea, abea, befb, bcgfb, cfgc, abcfeda
