\begin{problem}

  A group of $n \geq 1$ people can be divided into teams, each
  containing either 4 or 7 people.  What are all the possible values of
  $n$?  Use induction to prove that your answer is correct.

\begin{solution}

We begin by observing that the following numbers of people can be divided
into teams with 4 or 7 people per team:
\begin{align*}
4 & = 4 \\
7 & = 7 \\
8 & = 4 + 4 \\
11 & = 4 + 7 \\
12 & = 4 + 4 + 4 \\
14 & = 7 + 7 \\
15 & = 4 + 4 + 7 \\
16 & = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 \\
18 & = 4 + 7 + 7 \\
19 & = 4 + 4 + 4 + 7 \\
20 & = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 \\
21 & = 7 + 7 + 7,
\end{align*}
and these are the only numbers $\leq 21$ that can be divided into such
teams.  Now we claim that every group of $n \geq 18$ people can be divided
into teams, each containing either 4 or 7 people.

\begin{proof}
  The proof is by strong induction on $n$.  Let $P(n)$ be the proposition
  that a group of $n \geq 18$ people can be divided into teams, with each
  containing either 4 or 7 people.

  \inductioncase{Base cases:} As shown above $P(18)$, $P(19)$, $P(20)$ and
  $P(21)$ are true.

\inductioncase{Inductive step:} For all $n \geq 21$, we assume that $P(18)$,
$P(19)$ $\dots$ $P(n)$ are true in order to prove that $P(n+1)$ is true.

Since $n+1 = (n-3) + 4$, a team of 4 people can be removed from the set of
$n+1$ people, leaving $n-3 \geq 18$ people.  By induction hypothesis, the
$n-3$ people can be further divided into disjoint teams with 4 or 7
people.  Since this divides the $n+1$ people into teams with 4 or 7, we
have shown that $P(n+1)$ is true.  It follows by strong induction that
$P(n)$ holds for all $n \geq 18$.

So all the possible values of $n$ are 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and
$\geq 18$.
\end {proof}
\end{solution}
