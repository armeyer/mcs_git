\begin{problem}
Describe a total injective function $[=1\ \text{out}]$,
$[\le 1\ \text{in},]$ from $\reals \to \reals$ that is not a bijection.

\begin{solution}
The function $e^x$ is a nice example.

Another example is the function
\[
f(x) \eqdef \begin{cases}
  \dfrac{1}{x}  & \text{if } \abs{x} > 1,\\
   x+2          & \text{if } \abs{x} \le 1.\\
            \end{cases}
\]
 
Note that the problem would be easy if we asked for a total injective
function $[=1\ \text{out}]$, $[\le 1\ \text{in},]$ from $\integers \to
\integers$ that is not a bijection; the function $2x$ is a simple
example.  But then we can extend this to reals by leaving non-integers
alone:

\[
g(x) \eqdef \begin{cases}
  2x  & \text{if } x \in \integers,\\
  x          & \text{if } x \notin \integers.\\
            \end{cases}
\]

\end{solution}
