\begin{problem}
We will say that a finite sequence of $n \geq 2$ positive integers is
\emph{good} if the sum of its elements is $2(n-1)$.  Prove that every
good sequence is a list of the degrees of the vertices of a tree.
\hint Induction.

\begin{solution}
The proof will be by induction on $n$ with induction hypothesis that
every good sequence of length $n$ is a list of the degrees of the
vertices of a tree.

\inductioncase{Base case} ($n = 2$): The only possible good sequence
is $\ang{1,1}$, which is the list of degrees of a 2-vertex tree.

\inductioncase{Induction step}: Suppose $D$ is a good sequence of
length $n+1$ where $n\geq 2$.  So the sum of the elements in $D$ is
$2n$.  We need to show that $D$ is a list of the degrees of the
vertices of some tree with $n+1$ vertices.

There must be an element of $D$ equal to 1, since otherwise the sum of
the $n+1$ elements of $D$ would be greater that $2n$.  Likewise, $D$
must have an element $d>1$, or else the sum would be $n+1$, which is
less than $2n$ since $n \geq 2$.

Let $D'$ be the length $n$ sequence obtained by deleting from $D$ an
element equal to 1 and replacing an element $d>1$ by $d-1$.  Then
$D'$ is a sequence of $n$ positive integers whose sum is $2n-2 =
2(n-1)$, so $D'$ is also good.

Now by induction hypothesis, $D'$ is the sequence of degrees of the
vertices of some $n$-vertex tree $T'$.  In particular, $T'$ must have
a vertex of degree $d-1$.  Let $T$ be the $(n+1)$-vertex tree obtained
from $T'$ by attaching a new leaf to a vertex of degree $d-1$.  This
implies that $D$ is a list of the vertex degrees of $T$, which
completes the proof of the inductive step.
\end{solution}
