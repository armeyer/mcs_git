\begin{problem}
Start with 110 coins on a table, 10 showing heads and 100 showing tails.

There are two ways to change the coins:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] Remove $20$ coins from the table, $10$ of which must be 
  \emph{heads} and the other $10$ must be \emph{tails}, or
\item[(ii)] Let $n>0$ be the number of heads showing.  If there are 
  \emph{more tails than heads} on the table, place $n$ additional coins,
  all showing heads, on the table.
\end{enumerate}

\ppart
Model this situation as a state machine, carefully defining the set of
states, the start state and the possible state transitions.
\hint Be sure to state the conditions of the state transitions.
\begin{solution}
States are tuples of the form $(H, T)$ where $H,T \in \nngint$.  The
start state is $(10, 100)$.  The transitions are of the form $(H, T)
\rightarrow (2H, T)$ with the restriction of $T > H > 0$, and $(H, T)
\rightarrow (H-10, T-10)$ with the restriction of $H,T \ge 10$.
\end{solution}

\examspace[2.0in]

\ppart Let $H \eqdef \text{the number of heads}$ and $T \eqdef
\text{the number of tails}$.  For each of the derived variables below,
indicate the \emph{strongest} of the following properties that it
satisfies: \emph{constant} \textbf{C}, \emph{strictly increasing}
\textbf{Sinc}, \emph{strictly decreasing} \textbf{Sdec}, \emph{weakly
  increasing} \textbf{Winc}, \emph{weakly decreasing} \textbf{Wdec},
\emph{none of these} \textbf{N}.

% Prove that any long enough sequence of transitions will arrive at a

% derived variable and proving that it has a minimum value.
