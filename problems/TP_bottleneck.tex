\begin{problem}
Show that there is no perfect matching for the bipartite graph
$G$ in Figure~\ref{fig:bipartite_with_bneck} by listing the vertices
in a set that forms a \emph{bottleneck}.  (You may choose a subset of
vertices from $\rightbi{G}$ or a subset from $\leftbi{G}$.)

\end{figure}

\begin{solution}
The set $\set{a,b,c,e}$ is a bottleneck:
\[
\card{H(\set{a,b,c,e})} = \card{\set{v,x,y}} = 3 < 4 = \card{\set{a,b,c,e}}.
\]

The set $\set{w,z}$ is a bottleneck in the other direction:
\[
\card{H^{-1}(\set{w,z})} = \card{\set{d}} = 1 < 2 = \card{\set{w,z}}.
\]
\end{solution}
