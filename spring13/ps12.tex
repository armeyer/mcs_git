% Problems start here
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Discrete Probability
%\pinput{CP_a_baseball_series} - too easy

% Conditional Probability
%\pinput{TP_bayes_proof} - uninformative proof
\pinput{PS_conditional_aces}
\pinput{PS_conditional_space}

% Random variables, Density Functions
\pinput{CP_equal_ranvars}  %PS_equal_birthdays much longer version

% good, relatively short problem after two long problems.

%\pinput{PS_independent_random_variables}

%\pinput{FP_product_rule_and_independence} - good exercise, but might be difficult to grade
