\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Recursive Definitions

Consider the function
\begin{equation*}
f(n) ::= 5n
\end{equation*}
on the nonnegative integers.

This function can also be defined by a recursive definition with base
case
\begin{equation*}
f(0) ::= 0,
\end{equation*}
and a recursive (``constructor'') case.

Identify the possible correct \emph{recursive cases} that would
recursively define this sequence.
   
\begin{enumerate}
  
\item $f(n+1) = 5(n+1)$
  
\item $f(n+1) = 5 f(n)$
  
\item $f(n+1) = f(n+5)$
  
\item $f(n+1) = f(n) + 5$
  
\item $f(n+1) = f(n) + f(1)$

\end{enumerate}

%%  Write your answer as a sequence of
%%  digits in any order, such as 
%%  \begin{equation*}
%%  \texttt{1 4 3}
%%  \end{equation*}

\begin{solution}

1,
4,
4


Choice~(4) is the most straightforward recursive definition.
Choice~(1) is also correct: a recursive case of $f(n+1)$ \emph{may}
mention $f(n)$, but it doesn't have to---but you could argue that then
it wouldn't be a \emph{recursive} definition, so omitting~(1) was not
penalized.  Choice~(2) defines the wrong function, $f(n)::=0$ for
all~$n$.  Choices (3) and~(5) are not well-formed recursive cases,
because they do not define $f(n)$ for all $n\ge 1$.
