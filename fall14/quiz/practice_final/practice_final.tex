\begin{problem}{12}
Let $T$ be a positive integer. 
Consider the following recurrence equation:
    \begin{equation*}
        t(n) =  \frac{t(n+1)}{3} + \frac{2t(n-1)}{3} + 1 \text{ for } 1 \leq n \leq T - 1; \qquad t(0) = t(T) = 0.
\end{equation*}

Find a closed form solution for $t(n)$ for $0 \leq n \leq T$ as a function of $T$.

\solution[\newpage]{
The characteristic equation is  $x = \frac{x^2}{3} + \frac{2}{3}$. Thus we have that:

\[ x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0, \]
and so
\[ x = 1\mbox{ or } x=2 . \]

Thus the general homogenous solution is
\[ t_h(n) = a + b2^n. \]

We need to find some specific solution. A constant won't work, since it's already a soution to the homogenous problem. 
Thus, let's try $f(n) = pn + q$:

\[ pn + q  = \frac{pn + p + q}{3} + \frac{2pn -2p + 2q}{3}+ 1 \]
This has a solution $p=3$ (and for any value of $q$), so $t_p(n) = 3n$ is a particular solution.
Adding the homogenous solution, we obtain the general solution:
\[ t(n) = a + b 2^n + 3n. \]
Using $t(0) = 0$ and $t(T) = 0$, then:
\[ a  + b = 0 \mbox{ and } a + b2^T + 3T = 0. \]
Solving this, we obtain
\[ a = -b \mbox{ and } b(2^T -1 ) = -3T, \]
and hence
\[ a = - \frac{3T}{ 1-2^T } \mbox{ and } b = \frac{3T}{ 1-2^T }. \]
Thus
\[ t(n) = - \frac{3T}{1-2^T} + \frac{3T}{1-2^T}2^n + 3n. \]

    The \emph{Lucas numbers} $L_n$ are defined by the following recurrence:

Prove by induction that for all $n \geq 1$, 
\[ \sum_{j=0}^n L_j = L_{n+2} - 1. \]
\end{problem}

\solution[\newpage]{
    Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $\sum_{j=0}^n L_j = L_{n+2} - 1$, for some fixed $n$.

    Base case: $\sum_{j=0}^1 L_1 = 2 + 1 = 3$. $L_3 -1= L_1 + L_2 -1= 2L_1 + L_0 -1= 3$. So $P(1)$ holds.
    (Alternatively: you could show that in fact $P(0)$ holds and use that as the base case.)

    Now assume for the purposes of induction that $P(n)$ holds. 
    Thus
    \[ \sum_{j=0}^n L_j = L_{n+2} - 1. \]
    Then
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{j=0}^{n+1} L_j &= \sum_{j=0}^n L_j \;+\; L_{n+1}\\
                             &= (L_{n+2} - 1) \;+\; L_{n+1} \qquad \text{by inductive assumption}\\
                             &= L_{n+3} - 1 \qquad \text{by recurrence relation}.
    \end{align*}
    Hence $P(n+1)$ holds. Thus $P(n)$ holds for all $n \geq 1$ by induction.

\begin{problem}{15}

    Let $T$ be a tree with $n$ nodes, where $n$ is a positive integer.
Suppose we color each node of $T$ in a random way: each node is red with probability $1/3$, green with probability $1/3$ and blue with probability $1/3$, and the colors of distinct nodes are mutually independent.

    Find a formula for the probability that the resulting coloring is a proper coloring. 
    You do not need to give a full proof of your answer, but do include your reasoning. 

    \emph{(Hint: you may use the fact that any tree on at least $2$ nodes has at least one leaf.)}
%    You must give a proof that your formula is correct.

%    \emph{Answer is $(2/3)^{n-1}$. Argument: More than one way, but could e.g. do induction upon removing a leaf.}
\end{problem}
\solution[\newpage]{
The answer is $(2/3)^{n-1}$, as we will prove by induction.

Let $P(n)$ be the statement that a random coloring of any tree of $n$ nodes is a proper coloring with probability $(2/3)^{n-1}$.
Note that $P(1)$ holds; the coloring is always proper, and so the probability is $1$.

Now suppose $P(n)$ holds, and let $T$ be any tree with $n+1$ nodes. 
Let $v$ be any leaf of $T$, let $u$ be the node adjacent to $v$, and let $T'$ be the tree obtained by removing $v$.
Color $T$ randomly as prescribed. 
Since $T'$ has $n$ nodes, we know that the probability that the coloring restricted to $T'$ is proper is exactly $(2/3)^{n-1}$. 
Let us condition on this event; given that $T'$ is properly colored, what is the probability that $T$ is properly colored? 
This is just $2/3$; no matter the coloring of $T'$, we get a proper coloring of $T$ precisely if $v$ is colored a different color to $u$, which happens with probability $2/3$.

So the probability that $T$ is colored properly is
\begin{align*}
    \Pr[T \text{ properly colored}] &= \Pr[T \text{ properly colored} \mid T' \text{ properly colored}]\Pr[T' \text{ properly colored}]\\
                                    &= \frac23 \cdot (2/3)^{n-1}\\
                                    &= (2/3)^n.
\end{align*}
Hence $P(n+1)$ holds. Thus $P(n)$ holds for all $n \geq 1$ by induction.

\begin{problem}{15}

Prove that every connected graph $G = (V, E)$ with $|V| \geq 2$ contains at least two vertices $v_1, v_2$ such that $G-v_1$ is still connected, and $G-v_2$ is still connected.

\emph{A potential issue: one proof for this is simply: take any spanning tree of $G$ (we know this exists, from class). Any spanning tree has at least 2 leaves (in the book, so fair game). Removing any of these leaves, the graph must remain connected. 
Now that I write this down, maybe they wouldn't find this so easy to see anyway. So probably it's fine.}
\solution{

\textbf{} \\

\textbf{Proof:} \emph{(by strong induction)}

\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:} $P(n)$: Every connected graph with $n$ vertices contains at least two vertices $v_1, v_2$ such that $G-v_1$ is still connected, and $G-v_2$ is still connected.

\textbf{Base Case:} $P(2)$: Both vertices of $G$ satisfy the condition, as a subgraph of one node is trivially connected.

\textbf{Inductive Step:} Show that $P(2) \wedge P(3) \wedge \cdots \wedge P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)$.

Assume for the purposes of induction that $P(2) \wedge P(3) \wedge \cdots \wedge P(n)$ holds.

\textbf{Case I:} $\forall v \in V$, $G-v$ is connected. Then $P(n+1)$ holds.

\textbf{Case II:} $\exists v$ such that $G-v$ is not connected. Then $G-v$ is composed of at least two connected components $G_1, G_2, \dots, G_k$. Let $G_x'$ be the graph formed by adding back $v$ and only those edges that are incident to both $v$ and some vertex in $G_x$. Then, each $G_x'$ is a connected graph of at least two vertices but not more than $n$ vertices.

By strong induction, each $G_x'$ contains at least one vertex $v_i \ne v$ such that $G_x' - v_i$ is connected. Then $G - v_i$ is also connected (since $v$ "bridges" all the other connected components). Since we have at least two connected components, then we indeed have at least two vertices such that removing each vertex from $G$ leaves the remainder of the graph still connected.

Let $I_j$ be the indicator of the event $A_j$ that the $j$'th card from the left is the same as the $(j+1)$'st card, for $1 \leq j \leq 11$.
Let $R$ be the r.v. for the number of adjacent pairs. Then
\[ R = \sum_{j=1}^{11} I_j; \]
thus by linearity of expectation, 
\[ \ex{R} = \sum_{j=1}^{11} \ex{I_j} = \sum_{j=1}^{11} \Pr[A_j]. \]

%Fix some $j \in \{1,2,\ldots, 11\}$; we want to determine $\Pr[A_j]$. 
%Imagine constructing the random permutation of the cards by first putting down a card of value $j$ in a uniformly random position, and then making a uniformly random choice from the remaining positions to place the the second card of value $j$. (After that all the remaining cards are placed randomly, but we don't care what happens to them.)
%Then 
%\medskip
%
%\emph{An alternative way of calculating $\Pr[A_j]$:}

Fix some $j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 11\}$. Now we count the number of possible layouts for which cards $j$ and $j+1$ are the same. This is just 
\[ 6 \cdot \frac{10!}{(2!)^5}, \]
by the BOOKKEEPER lemma.
%TODO explanation
%since we can choose the number of the cards in spots $j$ and $j+1$, and then what remains is a word of length $10$ chosen 
On the other hand, the total number of possible layouts is
\[ \frac{12!}{(2!)^6}, \]
by similar reasoning. Thus
\[ \Pr[A_j] = \frac{610! / (2!)^5}{12!/(2!)^6} = \frac{2\cdot 6}{12 \cdot 11} = \frac{1}{11}. \]
Thus
\[ \ex{R} = 11 \cdot \frac1{11} = 1. \]

T-Pain is planning an epic boat trip and he needs to decide what to bring with him.

\begin{itemize}

    \item He \emph{definitely} wants to bring burgers, but they only come in packs of 6.

\item He and his two friends can't decide whether they want to dress formally or
casually. He'll either bring 0 pairs of flip flops or 3 pairs.

\item He doesn't have very much room in his suitcase for towels, so he can
  bring at most 2 (and might not bring any!)

\item In order for the boat trip to be truly epic, he has to bring at least 1
nautical-themed pashmina afghan.

\end{itemize}

\bparts

\ppart{7} Let $g_n$ be the the number of different ways for T-Pain to bring
$n$ items (burgers, pairs of flip flops, towels, and/or afghans) on his
boat trip, satisfying the restrictions above.  Express the generating function $G(x) \eqdef
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} g_nx^n$ as a quotient of polynomials.

  &  = \frac{(1+x+x^2)x^7}%
            {(1-x)(1+x+x^2)(1-x)}\\
  & = \frac{x^7}{(1-x)^2}
\end{align*}

}

\ppart{7} Let $H(x) \eqdef \sum_{n=0}^\infty h_nx^n$ be the generating function for the sequence $h_0, h_1, h_2, \ldots$ representing the number of ways T-Pain could write an epic book of $n$ chapters about his boat trip. It turns out that
\[ H(x) = \frac{3-2x}{(1-x)^2} - 2. \]
Using this information, determine a closed formula for $h_n$.

\solution[\newpage]{
    We have
    \[ H(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} + \frac{2}{1-x} - 2. \]
    Recall that 
    \[ \frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n. \]
    Thus
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} &= \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)\\
                  &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{d}{dx} x^n\\
                  &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty nx^{n-1}\\
                  &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n+1)x^n.
\end{align*}
Hence
\begin{align*}
    H(x) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)x^n + 2\sum_{n=1}^\infty x^n \;-\; 2\\
         &= 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty (n+3)x^n.
\end{align*}
So $h_n = n+3$ for $n \geq 1$, and $h_0 = 1$.

Alyssa, an industrious software developer, writes 100 lines of code each hour, with probability $p$ of making a mistake each hour (she never makes more than one mistake in an hour, though).

    Consider the following game. You have the following grid:

    There are 25 balls in a bucket, numbered from 1 to 25. 
    7 of these balls are randomly chosen from the bucket. You cross out the 7 numbers on your grid corresponding to the selected balls. 
    If you cross out an entire row, an entire column, or either of the diagonals, then you win! E.g., if the draw yields balls 2, 6, 7, 12, 15, 17 and 22, then you win.

    What is the probability of winning?
\end{problem}

\solution[\newpage]{
    Call a row, column, or diagonal of boxes a \emph{line}.
    Fix any line. The probability that we cross out all the squares in this line is
    \[ \frac{{20 \choose 2}}{{25 \choose 7}}. \]
    We can never cross out more than one line at the same time, so we just need to multiply by the number of possible lines. Thus the total probability is
    \[ 12 \cdot \frac{{20 \choose 2}}{{25 \choose 7}}. \]

    %A rock-paper-scissors tournament is 
    Consider the following tennis tournament. There are $n$ players, and every pair of players play against each other once.
    Moreover, all the players are equally matched, and so the winner of each matchup is uniformly random; the game outcomes are also mutually independent.

    Call a player \emph{awesome} if they win all their games, and \emph{terrible} if they lose all of them.

    \bparts
    \ppart{5}  What is the probability that there will be an awesome player?

    \solution[\newpage]{
    Consider an arbitrary fixed player $i$, and let $E_i$ be the event that player $i$ is awesome. 
    Then $\pr{E_i} = 2^{-(n-1)}$, since to be awesome player $i$ must win all their $n-1$ games. 
    Now observe that there cannot be more than one awesome player (since between two players, whoever lost their match cannot be awesome).
    So all the events $E_i$ are disjoint; thus
    \[ \pr{E_1 \cup E_2 \cdots \cup E_n} = \sum_{i=1}^n \pr{E_i} = n2^{-(n-1)}. \]
    }
    \ppart{5} What is the probability that there will be both an awesome player and a terrible player?

    \solution[\vspace{12cm}]{
        Let $E_{i,j}$ be the probability that player $i$ is awesome and player $j$ is terrible, for $i,j \in \{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ and $i \neq j$.

        \[ \pr{E_{i,j}} = 2^{-(2n-3)}, \]

        Again, the events $E_{i,j}$ are all disjoint, and so
        \[ \pr{\text{both an awesome and a terrible player}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j \in \{1, 2, \ldots n\} : j \neq i} E_{i,j} = n(n-1) 2^{-(2n-3)}. \]
    }

    \ppart{5} What is the probability that there will be neither an awesome player nor a terrible player?

    \solution{
        The probability that there is a terrible player is the same as the probability that there is an awesome player. Thus, using the inclusion-exclusion principle,
    \begin{align*}
    \pr{\text{no awesome or terrible player}} &= 1 - 2n2^{-(n-1)} + n(n-1)2^{-(2n-3)}\\
                                              &= 1 - n2^{-(n-2)} + n(n-1)2^{-(2n-3)}.
    \end{align*}
}

%    \emph{This is another counting question really. One tricky point is that there can be simultaneously an awesome and useless player (but never more than one of each), so inclusion-exclusion is needed. So a bit tricky---but not so difficult.}
