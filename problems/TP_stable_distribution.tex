\begin{problem}
A \term{sink} in a digraph is a vertex with no edges leaving
it.  Circle whichever of the following assertions are true of
\idx{stable distributions} on finite digraphs with exactly two sinks:

\begin{itemize}

\item there may not be any

\item there may be a unique one

\item there are exactly two

\item there may be a countably infinite number

\item there may be a uncountable number

\item there always is an uncountable number

\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}
The first three choices are false, and the last three are true.
That's because a distribution in which one sink has probability $r \in
[0,1] \subseteq \reals$ and the other sink has probability $1-r$ is
stable, and there are an uncountable number of real numbers in $[0,1]$.
\end{solution}
\end{problem}
