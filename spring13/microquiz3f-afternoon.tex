\begin{problem}
Figure \ref{fig:img} shows the arrow diagram for a relation, $R$.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[height = 2in ]{image-inverseimage2}

\caption{Relation $R$.}
\label{fig:img}
\end{figure}
\bparts

\ppart List the elements in the image under $R$ of the even numbers in domain $X$.\hfill\brule{1.5in}

\ppart List the elements in the inverse image under $R$ of the vowels in codomain $Y$.\hfill\brule{1.5in}

\ppart List the first letters of \emph{all} the properties below
satisfied by relation $R$.\hfill\brule{1.0in}
\begin{center}
 \textbf{f}unction ($[\le 1\ \text{out}]$)\qquad \textbf{t}otal ($[\ge
   1\ \text{out}]$)

 \textbf{i}njective ($[\le 1\ \text{in}]$)\qquad \textbf{s}urjective
 ($[\ge 1\ \text{in}]$)\qquad \textbf{b}ijective ($[= 1\ \text{in, } =
   1\ \text{out}]$)

\begin{problem}
Let $C$ be the set of length 10 sequences of AS\textbf{C}II symbols
(there are 64 different symbols), $R$ the set of length 10 sequences
of letters from the \textbf{R}oman alphabet (26 letters), $S$ the
set of length 10 binary \textbf{s}trings (strings of bits), and $P$
all the subsets of $\set{\text{a,b,c,d,e,0,1,\&,\%,\#}}$.

For each of the following pairs of sets, write \textbf{B} to
indicate the bij relation holds between them, \textbf{S} to indicate
the surj relation but not the bij relation, and \textbf{I} to indicate
the inj relation but not the bij relation.
\bparts

\ppart $P$\brule{0.3in}$S$.
