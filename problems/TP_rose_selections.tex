\begin{problem}
How many different ways are there to select an unordered bundle of three dozen
colored roses if red, yellow, pink, white, purple and orange roses are
available? Please explain your answer (you may leave it un-simplified).

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{36+5}{5} \, .
\]

There is a bijection from selections of three dozen roses to
bit-strings with three dozen 0's and five 1's (to delimit the 
numbers of roses of each of the six colors are chosen).
\end{solution}
