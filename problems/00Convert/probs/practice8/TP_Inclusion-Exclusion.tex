%% type: short-answer
%% title: Inclusion-Exclusion

Let $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, $A_{3}$ be sets with $|A_{1}| = 100$, $|A_{2}| =
1,000$, $|A_{3}| = 10,000$.

Determine $|A_{1} \union A_{2} \union A_{3}|$ in each of the following
cases.

%%  If there is insufficient data to determine the answer, 
%%  write \textbf{nd} for \textbf{n}ot \textbf{d}etermined. 
%%  
%%  Type in your answers as numbers \emph{without} commas.

$A_{1} \subset A_{2} \subset A_{3}$.

\begin{solution}

10000

Since all the elements of $A_{1}$ are in $A_{2}$ and all elements in
$A_{2}$ are in $A_{3}$, the only elements in their union are the
elements of $A_{3}$.  Therefore, the size of the union is simply the
size of $A_{3}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart 
The sets are pairwise disjoint.

\begin{solution}
11100

Since the sets are pairwise disjoint (i.e. $A_{1}$ shares no elements
with $A_{2}$ or $A_{3}$ and $A_{2}$ shares no elements with $A_{3}$),
the Sum Rule implies that the size of the union is the sum of the
sizes of the individual sets.
\end{solution}

\ppart 
For any two of the sets, there is exactly one element in both.

\begin{solution}

ndNDNd

The number depends on whether the element is common to all three, and
so we cannot determine the answer from the information given.  From
the viewpoint of the inclusion-exclusion formula, we don't know if the
value of $|A_{1} \intersect A_{2} \intersect A_{3}|$ is 0 or 1
\end{solution}

\ppart 
There are two elements common to each pair of sets and one element in
all three sets.

\begin{solution}
11095

To solve this, we apply the inclusion-exclusion formula:
\begin{align*}
|A_{1} \union A_{2} \union A_{3}|
 & = |A_{1}|+|A_{2}|+|A_{3}|-|A_{1} \intersect A_{2}|-|A_{1}
\intersect A_{3}|-|A_{2} \intersect A_{3}|+|A_{1} \intersect
A_{2} \intersect A_{3}| \\
 & = 100+1000+10000-2-2-2+1 \\
 & = 11095.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
