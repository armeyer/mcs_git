\begin{solution}
\textbf{14}.

With total degree 26 there are 13 edges.  The largest number of
vertices in a connected graph with 13 edges is a tree with 14 vertices.
\end{solution}

\ppart what is the smallest possible number of vertices?

\exambox{0.5in}{0.5in}{0.0in}

\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
\textbf{6}.

A complete graph has the largest possible number of edges for a given
number of vertices.  The complete graph $K_6$ has 15 edges, so by
deleting two edges one can get a connected graph with 13 edges.

The complete graph $K_5$ has 10 edges, which is too small.
