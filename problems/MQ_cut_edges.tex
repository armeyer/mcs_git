\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a connected simple graph.  Prove that if an edge in a
connected graph is not included in any cycle, then it is a cut
edge.
\iffalse
\footnote{A cycle is a subgraph of $G$ isomorphic to the
  cycle graph $C_n$ for $n \geq 3$.  An edge is a \term{cut-edge} when
  removing the edge disconnects the graph.}
\fi


\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}

Supppose edge $\edge{u}{v}$ is not a cut-edge.  We show that it must
be included in a cycle.

Since the edge is not a cut-edge, the graph obtained by removing the
edge is connected.  So there exists a walk from $u$ to $v$ which does
not include $\edge{u}{v}$.  We proved in lecture that the shortest
such walk from $u$ to $v$ must be a path.  But this path
together with $\edge{u}{v}$ is a cycle that includes
$\edge{u}{v}$.

\end{proof}
\end{solution}
