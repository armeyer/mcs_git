\begin{problem}
Fill in the boxed entries in the multinomial coefficent below: the
mapping from permutations of the subscripted letters
\iffalse
$\text{c}\,\text{a}_1\,\text{l}_1\,\text{l}_2\,\text{a}_2\,\text{b}\,\text{a}_3\,\text{s}\,\text{h}$
\fi
$\text{c},\text{a}_1,\text{l}_1,\text{l}_2,\text{a}_2,\text{b},\text{a}_3,\text{s},\text{h}$
  to permutations of the letters in the word ``callabash'' is
  $n$-to-one for
\[
n = \paren{\begin{array}{c}
\examboxplain{0.2in}{0.0in}{0.2in}\\
\\
\examboxplain{1.2in}{0.2in}{0.0in}
\end{array}}
\]

\begin{staffnotes}
As a 2 point problem: 1 point if bottom 1's are omitted; also 1 point
if ``9'' is replaced by ``8'' or ``10.''  No points if anything other
on bottom than one 2, one 3, and some 1's.
\end{staffnotes}


\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{9}{3,2,1,1,1,1}
\]
\end{solution}
