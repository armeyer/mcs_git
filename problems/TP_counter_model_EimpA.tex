\begin{problem}
Find a counter-model showing the following is not valid.
\[
\exists x . P(x) \QIMPLIES \forall x . P(x)
\]

(Just define your counter-model. You do not need to verify that it is correct.)

\begin{solution}
 Define $P(x) \eqdef [x=1]$ and let the domain of discourse be the
 two element set $\set{1,2}$.  

 In this counter-model, the left-hand side of the implication is true
 since there is an $x$, namely $x=1$, for which $P(x)$ is true.  The right
 hand side is false because it is not true that every element in
 $\set{1,2}$ is equal to 1.  Therefore the implication does not hold and
 the statement is not valid.
\end{solution}
