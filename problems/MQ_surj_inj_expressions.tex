\begin{problem}
Let $R:A \to B$ be a binary relation.
\bparts

\ppart Prove that $R$ is a function iff $R \compose \inv{R} \subseteq \ident{B}$.

\begin{solution}
Here's an ``arrow'' argument: suppose you start at $b \in B$, go
backward along an incoming arrow to an $a \in A$, and then go forward
from $a$ some element of $B$.  You can be sure the element you get
back to is the $b$ you started from iff there is only one arrow out of
$a$, that is, iff $R$ is a function.
\end{solution}

\eparts Write similar containment formulas involving $\inv{R} \compose
R$, $R \compose \inv{R}$, $\ident{a}$, $\ident{B}$ equivalent to the
assertion that $R$ has each of the following properties.  No proof is required.

\bparts
\ppart total.
\begin{solution}
$\ident{A}  \subseteq  \inv{R} \compose R$
\end{solution}

\ppart a surjection.
\begin{solution}
$\ident{B} \subseteq R \compose \inv{R}$
\end{solution}

\ppart a injection.
\begin{solution}
$\inv{R} \compose R  \subseteq \ident{A}$
\end{solution}
\eparts
