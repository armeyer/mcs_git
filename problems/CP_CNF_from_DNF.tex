\begin{problem}
  Explain a simple way to obtain a \idx{conjunctive normal form} (CNF)
  for a propositional formula directly from a \idx{disjunctive normal
    form} (DNF) for its complement.

  \hint DeMorgan's Law does most of the job. Try working an
  illustrative example of your choice before describing the general
  case.

  \begin{solution}
    We'll follow the suggestion by starting with an example.  As we
    know, ``proof by example'' is not a valid form of proof, and this
    worked example is not required for a formal write-up.  We include
    it here for clarity.
    
    The idea is to negate the given DNF and simplify as
    much as possible with DeMorgan's Law. For the example
    \[
      \bar{F} = (A \QAND B) \QOR (B \QAND \bar{C}),
    \]
    negating this formula and applying DeMorgan's Law yields
    \begin{align*}
      F &\iff \QNOT((A \QAND B) \QOR (B \QAND \bar{C})) \\
        &\iff \QNOT(A \QAND B) \QAND \QNOT(B \QAND \bar{C}).
    \end{align*}
    Now we can turn each of the negated products into a sum by
    applying DeMorgan's Law again:
    \begin{equation*}
      F \iff (\bar{A} \QOR \bar{B}) \QAND (\bar{B} \QOR \bar{\bar{C}}).
    \end{equation*}
    Then removing double-negations yields the desired CNF:
    \[
      F \iff (\bar{A} \QOR \bar{B}) \QAND (\bar{B} \QOR C).
    \]

    Now for a fully general argument.  Suppose $\bar{F}$ is given in
    disjunctive form as $$\bar{F} = C_1 \QOR C_2 \QOR \cdots \QOR
    C_n$$.  Formula $F$ is equivalent to $\QNOT(\bar{F})$, which may
    be rewritten using DeMorgan's law for distributing \QNOT\ over
    \QOR, namely $F$ is equivalent to
    \begin{equation}\label{againDeMnotor}
      \bar{C_1} \QAND \bar{C_2} \QAND \cdots \QAND \bar{C_n}.
    \end{equation}
    Each clause $C_i$ from $\bar{F}$ has the form $(L_1 \QAND L_2
    \QAND \cdots \QAND L_m)$, where each $L_j$ is a \emph{literal} (a
    variable or a negated variable).  By DeMorgan's law again, each
    $\bar{C_i}$ may be simplified into the equivalent disjunction
    \begin{equation*}
      (\bar{L_1} \QOR \bar{L_2} \QOR \cdots \QOR \bar{L_m}).
    \end{equation*}
    If any of these literals $L_j$ was already a negated variable, say
    $L_j = \bar{X}$, then $\bar{L_j}$ should be replaced
    with the original variable $X$, since $\bar{\bar{X}}$ is
    equivalent to $X$.

    Applying the transformation from the previous paragraph to each
    clause in~\eqref{againDeMnotor} results in the desired CNF for
    $F$.

  \end{solution}
