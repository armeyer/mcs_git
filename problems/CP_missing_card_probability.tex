\begin{problem}
There are two decks of cards.  One is complete, but the other is
missing the ace of spades.  Suppose you pick one of the two decks with
equal probability and then select a card from that deck uniformly at
random.  What is the probability that you picked the complete deck,
given that you selected the eight of hearts?  Use the \idx{four-step
  method} and a \idx{tree diagram}.


\begin{staffnotes}
Try to get a brief discussion going on the issue ``How could knowing
about the eight of hearts be relevant to the presence of the ace of
spades?''
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
Let $C$ be the event that you pick the complete deck, and let $H$ be
the event that you select the eight of hearts.  In these terms, our
aim is to compute:

\begin{equation*}
\prcond{C}{H} = \frac{\pr{C \cap H}}{\pr{H}}
\end{equation*}

A tree diagram is worked out below:

\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic[height=3in]{incomplete-deck}
\end{figure}

Now we can compute the desired conditional probability as follows:

\begin{align*}
\prcond{C}{H} & = \frac{\pr{C \cap H}}{\pr{H}} \\
              & = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{52}}
                       {\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{52} +
                        \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{51}} \\
              & = \frac{51}{103} \\
              & = 0.495146\ldots
\end{align*}

Thus, if you selected the eight of hearts, then the deck you picked is
less likely to be the complete one.  It's worth stopping to think
about how you might have arrived at this final conclusion without
going through the detailed calculation---or better, how you might
explain it to your 10-year-old niece.

The explanation is simple: drawing an eight of hearts from a small
deck containing an eight of hearts is more likely than drawing one
from a larger such deck.  So if you see an eight of hearts, it's more
likely to have come from a smaller deck.  The soundness of this
intuitive explanation is proved in
Problem~\bref{FP_conditional_prob_inequality}.
