{\bf Initial Condition:}
Each of the $N$ boys has an ordered list of the $N$
girls according to his preferences.  Each of the girls has an ordered
list of the boys according to her preferences.

\begin{itemize}
\item Morning:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each girl stands on her balcony
\item Each boy stands under the balcony of his favorite girl
whom he has not yet crossed off his list and serenades.
If there are no girls left on his list, he stays home and does 6.042 homework.
\end{itemize}
\item Afternoon:
\begin{itemize}
\item Girls who have at least one suitor say to their favorite

\item To the others, they say ``No, I will never marry you!''
\end{itemize}
