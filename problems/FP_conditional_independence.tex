\begin{problem}
\iffalse Here is a straightforward modification of the notion of independence. \fi

Events $A, B, C$ are said to be \emph{conditionally
  independent} if 
\[
\prcond{A \intersect B}{C} = \prcond{A}{C} \cdot \prcond{B}{C} .
\]

Describe events $A,B,C,D$ and explain why they disprove the following:

\begin{falseclm*}
If $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$, and are also
conditionally independent given $D$, then $A$ and $B$ are
conditionally independent given $C \intersect D$.
\end{falseclm*}

\hint Choose $A,B,C,D$ 3-way but not 4-way independent.

\begin{solution}
Choose $A,B,C,D$ 3-way but not 4-way independent.  Then $A$ and $B$
are conditionally independent, given $C$ or given $D$ by 3-way independence.  But
\begin{align*}
\prcond{A \intersect B}{C \intersect D}
 & \eqdef \frac{\pr{ A \intersect B \intersect C\intersect D}}{\pr{C \intersect D}}\\
 & \neq \frac{\pr{A} \cdot \pr{B} \cdot \pr{C} \cdot \pr{D}}{\pr{C \intersect D}}
      & \text{(not 4-way independent)}\\
 & = \frac{\pr{A} \cdot \pr{B} \cdot \pr{C} \cdot \pr{D}}{\pr{C} \cdot \pr{D}}
      & \text{(2-way independence of $C,D$)}\\
 & = \pr{A} \cdot \pr{B}\\
 & = \prcond{A}{C \intersect D} \cdot \prcond{B}{C \intersect D}
      & \text{(3-way independence)},
\end{align*}
so $A$ and $B$ are not independent given $C \intersect D$.

An explicit example would be $A$, $B$ and $C$ being the events that
the first, second and third tosses, respectively, came up Heads in
three independent tosses of a fair coin, with $D$ being the event that
an even number of Heads were tossed
(Problem~\bref{CP_three_fair_coins}).

\end{solution}

\begin{falseclm*}
If $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$, and are also
conditionally independent given $D$, then $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C
\union D$.
\end{falseclm*}
\hint $C=A$, $D=\bar{A}$.
\begin{solution}
A simple counterexample is as follows. Notice that $A$ is certain given $A$, so everything is independent of
$A$ given $A$, and similarly everything is independent of $A$ given
$\bar{A}$.  But an event is independent of $A$ given $A \union
\bar{A}$ iff it simply is independent of $A$.  So $C=A$, $D=\bar{A}$, and
$B$ any event that is not independent of $A$ provides a
counterexample.
%\begin{staffnotes}
Here is an alternate, more formal argument. Let $B$ and $C$ be $A$, and $D$ be $\bar{A}$.  Then
\begin{align*}
\prcond{A \intersect B}{C}
  & = \pr{A \intersect A}/\pr{A}\\
  & = 1\\
  & = \prcond{A}{A} \cdot \prcond{A}{A}\\
  & = \prcond{A}{C} \cdot \prcond{B}{C},
\end{align*}
and so $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$.  Similarly,
\[
\prcond{A \intersect B}{D} = 0 = \prcond{A}{D} \cdot \prcond{B}{D} 
\]
and so $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $D$.
$A$ and $B$ are independent given $C \union D$ iff $A$ is
independent of $A$, which is clearly false for all nontrivial events $A$.
\end{solution}
