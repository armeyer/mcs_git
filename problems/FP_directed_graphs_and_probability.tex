\ppart For the directed acyclic graph (DAG) $G_0$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:Gdir}, a minimum-edge DAG with the same walk relation
can be obtained by removing some edges.  List these
edges\inbook{.}\inhandout{ (use notation $\diredge{u}{v}$ for an edge
  from $u$ to $v$):

\begin{solution}
After removing edges $\diredge{1}{4}$, $\diredge{3}{2}$ and
$\diredge{3}{4}$, we get the minimum DAG.
\end{solution}

\ppart List the vertices in a maximal chain in $G_0$.

Let $G$ be the simple graph shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:simpleG}.

\begin{figure}

A directed graph $\Gdir$ can be randomly constructed from
$G$ by assigning a direction to each edge independently with
equal likelihood.

\ppart What is the probability that $\Gdir = G_0$?

\begin{solution}
\[
2^{-\card{\edges{G}}} = 2^{-7} =\frac{1}{128}

\ppart $\Gdir$ has the property that if it has a directed cycle, then
it has a length three directed cycle.  Use this fact to find the
probability that $\Gdir$ is a DAG.

\exambox{2.5in}{0.5in}{-0.8in}

\begin{solution}
The only possible length three directed cycles are the ones described by
$T_1,\dots,T_4$.  So the given property implies that $\Gdir$ is a DAG
iff $\lgunion_{i \in \Zintv{1}{4}} T_i$ does \emph{not} occur.

Now using the Inclusion-Exclusion principle,

\begin{align*}
\pr{\Gdir \text{ is a DAG}}
   & = 1 - \pr{T_1 \union T_2 \union T_3 \union T_4}\\
   & = 1 - \sum_{i \in \Zintv{1}{4}} \pr{T_i} + \sum_{i\neq j} \pr{T_i \intersect T_j}\\
   & \quad - \sum_{i\neq j \neq k} \pr{T_i \intersect T_j \intersect T_k}
        + \pr{T_1 \intersect T_2 \intersect T_3 \intersect T_4}\\
   & = 1 - 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{16} - 0 + 0\\
   & = \frac{3}{8}
\end{align*}
Here we're using the fact that the results of part~\eqref{prT1T1T2}
for $T_1,T_2,T_3$ hold by symmetry for $T_i,T_j,T_k$ for all distinct
values of $i,j,k \in \Zintv{1}{4}$.

\end{solution}
