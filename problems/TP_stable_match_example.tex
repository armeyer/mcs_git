\begin{problem}
See if you can come up with a stable marriage assignment given the
following preferences.  You are not expected to know/remember the
Mating Ritual that solves this problem in general.  (And if you do
remember the protocol, don't spoil your teammates' fun by telling
them.)

\begin{eqnarray*}
boys & \quad & girls \\
1 : C B E A D & \quad & A : 3 5 2 1 4 \\
2 : A B E C D & \quad & B : 5 2 1 4 3 \\
3 : D C B A E & \quad & C : 4 3 5 1 2 \\
4 : A C D B E & \quad & D : 1 2 3 4 5 \\
5 : A B D E C & \quad & E : 2 3 4 1 5
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
5A\ 2B\ 4C\ 3D\ 1E&& \text{a boy optimal matching}\\
3A\ 5B\ 4C\ D2\ 2E&& \text{girls get their 1st choice}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
