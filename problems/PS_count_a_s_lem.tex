\begin{problem}

\begin{definition*}
Define the number $\cnt{c}{s}$ of occurrences of the character $c \in A$ in
the string $s$ recursively on the definition of $s \in \strings{A}$:

\textbf{base case}: $\cnt{c}{\emptystring} \eqdef\ 0$.

\textbf{constructor case}:
\[
\cnt{c}{\ang{a,s}} \eqdef \begin{cases}
                           \cnt{c}{s}  &\text{ if } a \neq c,\\
                           1 + \cnt{c}{s} &\text{ if } a = c.
                           \end{cases}
\]
\end{definition*}

Prove by structural induction that for all $s,t \in \strings{A}$ and
$c \in A$
\[
\cnt{c}{s \cdot t} = \cnt{c}{s} + \cnt{c}{t}.
\]
