\ppart What's the probability that $0$ doesn't appear
among $k$~digits chosen independently and uniformly at random?

\begin{solution}
$9^k/10^k$
\end{solution}

\ppart A box contains $90$ good and $10$ defective screws. What's the
probability that if we pick $10$~screws from the box, none will be
defective?

\begin{solution}
$$\frac{\binom{90}{10}}{\binom{100}{10}} = \frac{(90!)^2}{100!80!}$$
\end{solution}

\ppart First one digit is chosen uniformly at random from $\set{1,2,3,4,5}$
and is removed from the set; then a second digit is chosen uniformly at
random from the remaining digits. What is the probability that an odd
digit is picked the second time?

\begin{solution}
Condition on the event that the first digit is odd, get
\[
\frac{2}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{5}+\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{5} =
  \frac{12}{20} = \frac{3}{5}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Suppose that you \emph{randomly} permute the digits $1,
2,\cdots,n$, that is, you select a permutation uniformly at random.  What
is the probability the digit $k$ ends up in the $i$th position after the
permutation?

\begin{solution} $(n-1)!/ n! = 1/n$.  This makes perfect sense, since it's a
  random permutation, so any digit ends up in position i with
  probability $\frac{1}{n}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart A fair coin is flipped $n$ times.  What's the probability that
all the heads occur at the end of the sequence?  (If no heads occur,
then ``all the heads are at the end of the sequence'' is vacuously
true.)

\begin{solution}
$(n+1) {1/2}^{n}$.
\end{solution}
