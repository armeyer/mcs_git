\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Edges and Degrees

How many edges does a graph have if the degrees of its vertices are
4, 3, 3, 2, 2?

\begin{solution}
7.

In every graph, the sum of the degrees equals twice the number of
edges, since each edge adds 1 to the degree of two vertices.  Since $4+3+3+2+2 = 14$, we must have 7 edges.
\end{solution}
