  \pcomment{partial revision by ARM 3/16/13.  Whole approach to tree
    coloring via bipartite seems doubtful: why is it OK to appeal to
    the lemma that bipartite implies 2-colorable but not to appeal
    directly to the fact from lecture that trees are 2-colorable?...or
    the book theorem that no odd-length cycles implies 2-colorable?
    Also, bipartite is harder to prove than 2-coloring directly.  And
    technically, bipartite graphs come with a vertex partition, so you
    have to rephrase awkwardly as `The edge set of every tree equals
    the edge set of a bipartite graph.'}

\ppart\label{Bipartite} Prove by induction that every tree is
$2$-colorable.  As usual, be sure to carefully specify your induction
hypothesis.

\examspace[5in]

\begin{solution}
  The induction hypothesis $P(n)$ is the predicate ``every tree with
  $n$ vertices is $2$-colorable.''

\inductioncase{Base case} ($n=1$): A $1$-vertex tree is trivially
$2$-colorable. We don't even need both colors!

\inductioncase{Induction step}: Suppose $n \ge 1$, and assume that all
$n$-vertex trees are $2$-colorable. Let $T$ be an $(n+1)$-vertex tree;
we must show $T$ is $2$-colorable.

Because $T$ has at least two vertices, $T$ has at least one leaf
vertex, $v$.  Let the edge $v$ connects to in $T$ be $e \eqdef
\edge{v}{w}$.  Removing $v$ and $e$ from $T$ results in a new tree
$T'$ with only $n$ vertices, which by the induction hypothesis can be
colored with two colors.  Assign these same colors to the vertices of
$T$, and additionally, whatever color $w$ was assigned, choose the
\emph{other} color for vertex $v$.  This is a valid $2$-coloring of
$T$: all edges other than $e$ are colored the same as in a valid
coloring of $T'$ and therefore have different colors on their
endpoints, and vertex $v$ was colored precisely to make the coloring
of edge $e$ valid as well.
\end{solution}

\ppart From part~\eqref{Bipartite} it follows that \emph{almost} all
trees $T$ have chromatic number $\chi(T) = 2$.  What are the
exceptions, and what are their chromatic numbers?

\hint Think small. Recall that a simple graph, by definition, has a
nonempty set of vertices.

\begin{solution}
For every tree $T$, we've shown that $\chi(T) \le 2$.  If $T$ has at
least one edge, then both colors must be used on the two endpoints of
this edge, which proves that $\chi(T) = 2$.  So the only trees with
$\chi(T)\ne 2$ cannot have any edges.  A tree with $n$ vertices (where
$n$ must be $\ge 1$ by definition of simple graph) has precisely $n-1$
edges, so the only trees without edges have $n=1$ vertices.  These
$1$-vertex trees have chromatic number $1$, not $2$.
\end{solution}
