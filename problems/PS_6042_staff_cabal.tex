\begin{problem}
A certain cabal within the Math for Computer Science course staff is
plotting to make the final exam \emph{ridiculously hard}.
(``Problem 1.  Prove the Poincare Conjecture starting from the axioms
of ZFC.  Express your answer in khipu---the knot language of the
Incas.'')  The only way to stop their evil plan is to determine
exactly who is in the cabal.  The course staff consists of seven
people:
%
\[
\set{\Eric, \Tom, \Albert, \Oshani, \Edmond, \Florent, \Nick }
\]
The cabal is a subset of these seven.  A membership roster has been
found and appears below, but it is deviously encrypted in logic
notation.  The predicate $\cabal$ indicates who is in the cabal; that is,
$\cabal(x)$ is true if and only if $x$ is a member.  Translate each
statement below into English and deduce who is in the cabal.

\bparts

\ppart\label{eee} 
$\exists x, y, z. \,
    (x \neq y \QAND
     x \neq z \QAND
     y \neq z \QAND
     \cabal(x) \QAND \cabal(y) \QAND \cabal(z))$

\begin{solution}
  A direct English paraphrase would be ``There exist people we'll call
  $x,y$, and $z$, who are all different, such that $x,y$ and $z$ are each
  in the cabal.''  A better version would use the fact that there's no
  need in this case to give names to the people.  Namely, a better
  paraphrase is ``There are at least 3 different people in the cabal.''
  Perhaps a simpler way to say this is: ``The cabal is of size at least
  3.''
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{nNC} $\QNOT(\cabal(\Nick) \QAND \cabal(\Oshani))$

\begin{solution}
\Nick\ and \Oshani\ are not both in the cabal.
Equivalently: at least one of \Nick\ and \Oshani\ is not in the cabal.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{Fall} $\cabal(\Florent) \QIMPLIES \forall x.\, \cabal(x)$

\begin{solution}
If \Florent\ is in the cabal, then everyone is.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{CN} $\cabal(\Oshani) \QIMPLIES \cabal(\Nick)$

\begin{solution}
If \Oshani\ is in the cabal, then \Nick\ is also.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{EAnT}
$(\cabal(\Edmond) \QOR \cabal(\Albert)) \QIMPLIES \QNOT(\cabal(\Tom))$

\begin{solution}
  If either of \Edmond\ or \Albert\ is in the cabal, then \Tom\ is not.
  Equivalently, if \Tom\ \emph{is} in the cabal, then neither \Albert\ nor
  \Edmond\ is.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{ENnE}
$(\cabal(\Edmond) \QOR \cabal(\Nick)) \QIMPLIES \QNOT(\cabal(\Eric))$

\begin{solution}
If either of \Edmond\ or \Nick\ is in the cabal,
then \Eric\ is not.  Equivalently, if \Eric\ \emph{is} in the cabal, the
neither \Edmond\ nor \Nick\ is.  
\end{solution}

\ppart  Now use these facts to explain exactly who is on the cabal and why.

\begin{staffnotes}
  If a team is stuck, tell them that the cabal consists of exactly \Nick,
  \Edmond, and \Albert\ and have them check that this set satisfies all
  the conditions.  (See the end of the solution.)  Then start them back on
  proving that this is the unique set that works.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
So much for the translations.  We now argue that the only
cabal satisfying all six propositions above is one whose members are
exactly \Nick, \Edmond, and \Albert.

We first observe that by~\eqref{nNC}, there must be someone---either \Nick\
or \Oshani---who is not in the cabal.  But if \Florent\ were in the cabal, then
by~\eqref{Fall}, everyone would be.  So we conclude by contradiction
that:

\begin{equation}\label{nF}
\text{\Florent\ is not in the cabal.}
\end{equation}

Next observe that if \Oshani\ was in the cabal, then by~\eqref{CN}, \Nick\ would
be too, contradicting~\eqref{nNC}.  So by again contradiction, we conclude:
\begin{equation}\label{nC}
\text{\Oshani\ is not in the cabal.}
\end{equation}

Now suppose \Tom\ is in the cabal.  Then by~\eqref{EAnT}, \Edmond\ and
\Albert\ are not, and we already know \Florent\ and \Oshani\ are not, so
only three remain who could be in the cabal, namely, \Tom, \Nick, and
\Eric.  But by~\eqref{eee} the cabal must have at least three members, so
it follows that the cabal must consist of exactly these three.  This
proves:
\begin{lemma}[TNE]
\text{If \Tom\ is in the cabal, then \Nick\ and \Eric\ are in the cabal.}
\end{lemma}

But by~\eqref{ENnE}, if \Nick\ is in the cabal, then \Eric\ is not.  That is, 
\begin{lemma}[NnE]
\text{\Nick\ and \Eric\ cannot both be in the cabal.}
\end{lemma}
Now from Lemma~(NnE) we conclude that the conclusion of
Lemma~(TNE) is false.  So by contrapositive, the hypothesis of
Lemma~(TNE) must also be false, namely,
\begin{equation}\label{nT}
\text{\Tom\ is not in the cabal.}
\end{equation}

Finally, suppose \Eric\ is in the cabal.  Then by~\eqref{ENnE}, \Edmond\
and \Nick\ are not, and we already know \Florent, \Oshani\ and \Tom\ are not. So
the cabal must consist of at most two people (\Albert\ and \Eric). This
contradicts~\eqref{eee}, and we conclude by contradiction that
\begin{equation}%\label{nE}
\text{\Eric\ is not in the cabal.}
\end{equation}
So the only remaining people who could be in the cabal are \Albert, \Edmond,
and \Nick.  Since the cabal must have at least three members, we conclude
that
\begin{lemma*}
The only possible cabal consists of \Albert, \Edmond, and \Nick.
\end{lemma*}

But we're not done yet: we haven't shown that a cabal consisting of
\Albert, \Edmond, and \Nick\ actually does satisfy all six conditions.  So let
$\mathcal{A} =\set{\text{\Albert}, \text{\Edmond}, \text{\Nick}}$, and let's quickly
check that $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies~\eqref{eee}--\eqref{ENnE}:

\begin{itemize}

\ppart $\card{A} = 3$, so $A$ satisfies~\eqref{eee}.
\ppart \Oshani\ is not in $A$, so $A$ satisfies~\eqref{nNC} and~\eqref{CN}.
\ppart \Florent\ is not in $A$, so the hypothesis of~\eqref{Fall} is false, which
means that $A$ satisfies~\eqref{Fall}.
\ppart Finally, \Tom\ and \Eric\ are not in $A$, so the conclusions of
both~\eqref{EAnT} and~\eqref{ENnE} are true, and so $A$
satisfies~\eqref{EAnT} and ~\eqref{ENnE}.

\end{itemize}

So now we have proved
\begin{proposition*}
$\set{\Albert, \Edmond, \Nick}$ is the \emph{unique} cabal
satisfying conditions~\eqref{eee}--\eqref{ENnE}.
\end{proposition*}
\end{solution}
