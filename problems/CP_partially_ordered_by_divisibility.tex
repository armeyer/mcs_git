\begin{problem}
Show that the set of nonnegative integers partially ordered under the divides
relation\dots

\begin{problemparts}

\problempart 
\dots has a minimum element.

\begin{solution}
1 is minimum since it divides all nonnegative integers,
\end{solution}

\problempart 
\dots has a maximum element.

\begin{solution}
0 is maximum because everything divides 0 (including 0---look up the
definition of $ \divides n$).
\end{solution}

\problempart  
\dots has an infinite chain.

\begin{solution}
1 2 4 8 16 \dots is a chain with infinite length.
\end{solution}

\ppart \dots has an infinite antichain.

\begin{staffnotes}

\hint The primes.

\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
The set of prime numbers is infinite.  Since no prime divides another,
any two primes are incomparable.  So the set of prime numbers is an
antichain.
\end{solution}

\ppart  What are the minimal elements of divisibility on the integers
greater than 1?  What are the maximal elements?

\begin{solution}
The primes are the minimal elements.  There are no maximal elements.
\end{solution}

\end{problemparts}
