\begin{problem}
For each of the binary relations below, state whether it is a strict
partial order, a weak partial order, an equivalence relation, or none
of these.  If it is a partial order, state whether it is a linear
order.  If it is none, indicate which of the axioms for partial-order
and equivalence relations it violates.

\begin{staffnotes}
This problem took longer than expected for students to go through in
class.  Parts (f) and (h) are the trickiest parts, usually where
students made mistakes.  Give hints as needed to get them through
faster.

\bparts

\ppart The superset relation $\supseteq$ on the power set
$\power{\set{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}}$.

\begin{solution}
This is a weak partial order, but not a linear one.  For example, 
the sets of size 3 form an antichain.
\end{solution}

\ppart The relation between any two nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$ such that 
$a \equiv b \pmod{8}$.

%The remainder of $a$ divided by 8 equals the remainder of $b$ divided by 8.

\begin{solution}
An equivalence relation.%
\iffalse
Violates antisymmetry: $8 \mrel{R} 16$ and $16 \mrel{R} 8$ but $8 \neq
16$.  It is transitive, though.
\fi
\end{solution}

\ppart The relation between propositional formulas $G$ and $H$ such that $[G
\QIMPLIES H]$ is valid.

\begin{solution}
  Violates antisymmetry: $P$ and $\QNOT(\QNOT(P))$ imply each other but
  are different expressions.  It is transitive, though.
\end{solution}

\ppart The relation between propositional formulas $G$ and $H$ such that $[G
\QIFF H]$ is valid.

\begin{solution}
An equivalence relation.
\end{solution}


\ppart The relation `beats' on Rock, Paper, and Scissors (for those who don't
know the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats
Paper, and Paper beats Rock).

\begin{solution}
  Obviously violates transitivity.  Asymmetric, and hence also
  irreflexive and antisymmetric.
\end{solution}

\ppart The \idx{empty relation} on the set of real numbers.
\begin{solution}
  It's vacuously asymmetric and transitive, so it's a strict partial
  order.  It's not linear.  It's not an equivalence relation because
  it is not reflexive.
\end{solution}

\ppart The \idx{identity relation} on the set of integers.

\begin{solution}

  It's obviously reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive, so it's a
  weak partial order.  It's not linear.  It's also an equivalence
  relation since it is symmetric as well.
\end{solution}


\ppart The divisibility relation on the integers $\integers$.

\begin{solution}
Not antisymmetric: 3 and -3 divide each other.  It is transitive and reflexive.
\end{solution}
