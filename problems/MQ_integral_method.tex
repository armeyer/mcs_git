\begin{problem} 
Assume $n$ is an integer larger than 1.  Circle all the correct
inequalities below. 

Explanations are not required, but partial credit for wrong answers
will not be given without them.
%Do \emph{not} use a calculator.
\hint You may find the graphs in Figure~\ref{integrals_1overx_logx} helpful.

\begin{itemize}

\item $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \ln (i+1) \le \ln 2 + \int_1^n
\ln(x+1) dx $

\item $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \ln (i+1) \le \int_0^n \ln(x+2)
dx $

\item $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} \ge \int_0^n
\frac{1}{x+1} dx $

%\item $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} \le 1.5 + \int_3^n
%\frac{1}{x} dx $

\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}The 2nd and 3rd inequalities hold.\end{solution}
