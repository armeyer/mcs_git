\begin{problem}
  Let $f$, $g$ be real-valued functions such that $\lim_{x \to \infty}
  f(x) = \infty$ and $f \sim g$.

\bparts

\ppart Give an example of $f,g$ such that $2^f \not\sim 2^g$.

\solution{
\begin{align*}
f(n) & \eqdef n+1\\
g(n) & \eqdef n.
\end{align*}

Then $f \sim g$ since $\lim (n+1)/n = 1$, but $2^f= 2^{n+1} = 2\cdot 2^n =
2\cdot 2^g$ so
\[
\lim \frac{2^f}{2^g} = 2 \neq 1.
\]
}

\ppart Prove that $\log f \sim \log g$.

\solution{
\begin{align*}
\lim \frac{\log f}{\log g}
& = \lim \frac{(\log f)'}{(\log g)'} 
       & \text{(L'Hospital's rule)}\\
& = \lim \frac{1/f}{1/g} \\
& =  \lim \frac{1}{f/g} \\
& =  \frac{1}{\lim (f/g)} \\
& = 1/1 = 1.
\end{align*}

\iffalse
\begin{align*}
\lim \frac{f}{g} & = 1\\
\log \lim \frac{f}{g} & = \log 1\\
\lim \log\paren{\frac{f}{g}} & = 0\\
\lim \paren{\log f - \log g} & = 0\\
TBA
