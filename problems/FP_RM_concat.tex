Namely, if$s$ and $t$ are strings in \RM, then $s\cdot t \in \RM$.\inhandout{Remember to carefully state your induction hypothesis and  clearly label the base and constructor cases of your proof.}%\examspace[4in]\begin{solution}The proof is by structural induction on the definition of $s \in \RM$.\inductioncase{Induction hypothesis}:\[P(s) \eqdef \forall t \in \RM.\ \ s \cdot t \in \RM.\]\inductioncase{Base case}: ($s = \emptystring$). $P(s)$ holds, since$\emptystring \cdot t = t$ for all $t$, and so $s \cdot t \in \RM$ forall $t \in \RM$.\inductioncase{Constructor case}: Assume that $s = \lefbrk a \rhtbrkb$ for $a, b \in \RM$.  We must prove $P(s)$.We may assume by structural induction that $P(b)$ holds.  If $t \in\RM$, then $bt \in \RM$ by assumption $P(b)$.  Now,\[s \cdot t = (\lefbrk a \rhtbrk b) t = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk (b t),\]and the right hand term describes a string in $\RM$ by theconstructor.  This proves $P(s)$.By structural induction, we conclude that $P(s)$ is true for all $s\in \RM$, that is,\[\forall s, t \in \RM.\ s \cdot t \in \RM \]as claimed.\end{solution}\end{problem}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem ends here%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\endinput
