\begin{problem}

You would like to buy a bouquet of flowers.  You find an
online service that will make bouquets of \textbf{lilies}, \textbf{roses}
and \textbf{tulips}, subject to the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
\item there must be at most 1 lily,
\item there must be an odd number of tulips,
\item there must be at least two roses.
\end{itemize}

Example: A bouquet of no lilies, 3 tulips, and 5 roses satisfies the
constraints.

Express $B(x)$, the \idx{generating function} for the number of ways
to select a bouquet of $n$ flowers, as a quotient of polynomials (or
products of polynomials).  You do not need to simplify this
expression.

\begin{solution}
Generating function for the number of ways to choose
lilies:
\[
L(x) = 1+ x
\]

Generating function for the number of ways to choose tulips:
\[
T(x) = x + x^3 + x^5 + \cdots = \frac{x}{1-x^2}
\]

Generating function for the number of ways to choose roses:
\[
R (x) = x^2+x^3 + x^4 + \cdots = \frac{x^2}{1-x}
\]

By the \index{convolution} Convolution Property, the generating function
$B(x)$ is the product of these functions, namely,
\begin{align*}
B(x) & = L(x) R(x) T(x) \\
     & = (1+ x)\frac{x}{1-x^2} \frac{x^2}{1-x}\\
     & = \frac{x^3(1+ x)}{(1+x)(1-x)^2}\\
     & = \frac{x^3}{(1-x)^2}
\end{align*}

\end{solution}

\end{problem}
