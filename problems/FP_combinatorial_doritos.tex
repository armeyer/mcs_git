\begin{problem}
Each day, an MIT student selects a breakfast from among $b$
possibilities, lunch from among $l$ possibilities, and dinner from
among $d$ possibilities.  In each case one of the possibilities is
Doritos.  However, a legimate daily menu may include Doritos for at
most one meal.  Give a combinatorial (not algebraic) proof based on
the number of legimate daily menus that
\[\begin{array}{l}
bld-[(b-1)+(l-1)+(d-1)+1]\\
\qquad = (l-1)(d-1)  + (b-1)(d-1) + (b-1)(l-1) + (b-1)(l-1)(d-1).
\end{array}\]

\begin{solution}
Both sides of the equation equal the number of legimate daily menus.

The right-hand side counts the number of menus with Doritos at exactly 1
meal---for example, $(l-1)(d-1)$ is the number or menus with Doritos for
breakfast but not at lunch or dinner---plus the number of menus with no
Doritos.

The left-hand side counts the number $b\cdot l \cdot d$ of all
possible menus minus the number of illegimate menus.  The number of
illegimate menus are those including Doritos at exactly two
meals---for example, $(b-1)$ is the number menus with Doritos at lunch
and dinner but not at breakfast---plus the number of illegimate menus
with Doritos at all three meals, namely one.
\end{solution}
