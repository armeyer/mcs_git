\begin{problem}
\iffalse
The following problems give you an idea of how many relations and
functions there are given two sets.
\fi

Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite sets. How many binary relations from $X$ to $Y$ are there?

\begin{solution}
The set of all pairs $X\times Y$ has $\card{X} \cdot \card{Y}$
elements.  Any subset of $X\times Y$ can be the graph of a relation,
hence there are $2^{\card{X} \cdot \card{Y}}$ relations.
\end{solution}
