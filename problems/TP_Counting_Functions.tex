\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Counting Functions

How many total functions are there from set $A$ to set $B$ if $|A|=3$
and $|B|=7$?

%% You may answer with a formula such as \textbf{(3*7)^2/(3 + 7)!}

\begin{solution}
$7^3$

Each element in $A$ must be mapped to an element in set $B$ as the
function is total. Each element in $A$ has 7 choices. By the Product
Rule, there are $7^{3} = 343$ functions.
\end{solution}
