\begin{problem}
  Because of the incredible popularity of his class \emph{Math for
    Computer Science}, TA Mike decides to give up on regular office
  hours.  Instead, he arranges for each student to join some study
  groups.  Each group must choose a representative to talk to the
  staff, but there is a staff rule that a student can only represent
  one group.  The problem is to find a representative from each group
  while obeying the staff rule.

 \ppart Explain how to model the delegate selection problem as a
 bipartite matching problem.  (This is a \emph{modeling problem}; we
 aren't looking for a description of an algorithm to solve the
 problem.)

\begin{solution}
  Define a bipartite graph with the study groups as one set of vertices
  and students in the groups as the other set of vertices.  A group and a
  student are adjacent exactly when the student belongs to the group.  Now
  a matching of study groups to students will give a proper selection of
  delegates: every group will have a delegate, and every delegate will
  represent exactly one club.
\end{solution}

\examspace[2.5in]

\ppart The staff's records show that each student is a member of at
most 4 groups, and all the groups have 4 or more members.
%That's enough to guarantee there is a proper delegate selection.
Is that enough to guarantee there is a proper delegate selection?
Explain.

\begin{solution}
  The degree of every group is at least 4, and the degree of every student
  is at most 4, so the graph is \emph{\idx{degree-constrained}}
  (Def.~\bref{degree-constrained_def}) which implies there will be no
  bottlenecks to prevent a matching.  Hall's Theorem then guarantees a
  matching.
\end{solution}
