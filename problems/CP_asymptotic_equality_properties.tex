\begin{problem}
Suppose $f,g:\nngint^+ \to \nngint^+$ and $f \sim g$.

\bparts

\ppart Prove that $2f \sim 2g$.

\examspace[2.0in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\frac{2f}{2g} = \frac{f}{g},
\]
so they have the same limit as $n \to \infty$.

\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that $f^2 \sim g^2$.

\examspace[2.0in]

\begin{solution}

\[
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(n)^2}{g(n)^2} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \cdot \frac{f(n)}{g(n)}
 = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \cdot \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1.
\]

\end{solution}

\ppart Give examples of $f$ and $g$ such that $2^f \not\sim 2^g$.
Briefly explain your answer.

\examspace[2.0in]

\begin{solution}
A simple example is
\begin{align*}
f(n) & \eqdef n+1\\
g(n) & \eqdef n.
\end{align*}
Then $f \sim g$ since $\lim (n+1)/n = 1$, but $2^f= 2^{n+1} = 2\cdot 2^n =
2\cdot 2^g$ so
\[
\lim \frac{2^f}{2^g} = 2 \neq 1.
\]

There are lots of other examples, such as
\[
f(n) \eqdef n,\ g(n) \eqdef n + \log n.
\]

Then
\[
\frac{2^{f(n)}}{2^{g(n)}} = \frac{2^n}{2^{n + \log n}} = \frac{2^n}{2^n2^{\log n}} = \frac{1}{n},
\]
so
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{2^{f(n)}}{2^{g(n)}} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0 \neq 1
\]
which means in fact that, $2^f = o(2^g)$.
\end{solution}
