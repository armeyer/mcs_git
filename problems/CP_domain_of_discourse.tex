\begin{problem}
For each of the logical formulas, indicate whether or not it is true when
the domain of discourse is $\naturals$ (the nonnegative integers 0, 1, 2,
\dots), $\integers$ (the integers), $\rationals$ (the rationals), $\reals$
(the real numbers), and $\complexes$ (the complex numbers).

\[\begin{array}{rrrcl}
          & \exists x & (x^2 & = & 2)\\
\forall x & \exists y & (x^2 & = & y)\\
\forall y & \exists x & (x^2 & = & y)\\
\forall x\neq 0 & \exists y & (xy & = & 1)\\
\exists x & \exists y & (x + 2y & = & 2) \wedge (2 x + 4 y = 5)
\end{array}\]

\begin{solution}
\[
\begin{array}{llllll}
Statement & \naturals & \integers & \rationals & \reals & \complexes\\
\exists x\ (x^2=2) & f & f & f & t\ (x=\sqrt{2}) & t\\
\forall x \exists y\ (x^2 = y) & t & t & t & t\ (y=x^2)& t\\
\forall y \exists x\ (x^2=y) & f & f & f & f\ (\text{take }y<0) & t\\
\forall x\neq 0\exists y\ (xy=1) & f & f & t & t\ (y=1/x) & t\\
\exists x \exists y\ (x + 2y = 2) \wedge (2 x + 4 y = 5) & f & f & f & f & f
\end{array}
\]
