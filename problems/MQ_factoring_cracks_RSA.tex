\begin{problem}
Suppose a cracker knew how to factor the RSA modulus $n$ into the
product of distinct primes $p$ and $q$.  Explain how the cracker could
use the public key-pair $(e,n)$ to find a private key-pair $(d,n)$ that
would allow him to read any message encrypted with the public key.

\begin{solution}
The cracker just needs a $d$ that is an inverse modulo $(p-1)(q-1)$ of
$e$, since then he can decrypt messages in exactly the same way as the
owner of the private key (the Receiver).  By definition of RSA, $e$ is
chosen so that $\gcd(e, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1$, so a $d$ is easy to find
using the Pulverizer.
\end{solution}
