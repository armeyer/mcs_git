\begin{problem}
You have a random process for generating a positive integer $K$.  The
behavior of your process each time you use it is (mutually)
independent of all its other uses.  You use your process to generate an
integer, and then use your procedure repeatedly until you
generate an integer as big as your first one.  Let $R$ be the number
of additional integers you have to generate.

\bparts

\ppart\label{probKgeqk} State and briefly explain a simple closed formula for
$\expcond{R}{K=k}$ in terms of $\prob{K \geq k}$.

\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\expcond{R}{K=k} = \frac{1}{\prob{K \geq k}}
\]

If $K=k$, then we can think of generating a number $\geq k$ as a
failure, so the expected number of repeats is the mean time to
failure, which is the reciprocal of probability of failure on a given
try.
\end{solution}

Suppose $\prob{K = k} = \Theta(k^{-4})$.

\ppart \label{probKgeqkTheta}
Show that $\prob{K \geq k} = \Theta(k^{-3})$.

\examspace[2.5in]

\begin{solution}
It follows from the definition of $\Theta()$ that
\begin{equation}\label{Thetasum}
\text{If $f = \Theta(g)$, then $\sum_{n \in S} f(n) = \Theta\paren{\sum_{n \in S} g(n)}$}
\end{equation}
for any countable set $S$.  Therefore, with a slight abuse of
$\Theta()$ notation, we have
\begin{align*}
\prob{K \geq k}
   & = \sum_{m \geq k} \prob{K = m}\\
   & = \Theta\paren{\sum_{m \geq k} k^{-4}} & \text{by~\eqref{Thetasum}}\\
   & = \Theta\paren{\int_k^{\infty} x^{-4}\, dx} & \text{(the Integral Method)}\\
   & = \Theta\paren{k^{-3}}
\end{align*}

\end{solution}

\ppart  Show that $\expect{R}$ is infinite.


\begin{solution}
It follows from the definition of $\Theta()$ that
\begin{equation}\label{Thetamult}
\text{If $f_1 = \Theta(g_1)$ and $f_2 = \Theta(g_2)$, then $f_1 \cdot
  f_2 = \Theta(g_1 \cdot g_2)$.}
\end{equation}
Now we have By Total Expectation:
\begin{align*}
\expect{R}
   & = \sum_{k \in \integers^+} \expcond{R}{K=k} \cdot \prob{K=k}\\
   & = \sum_{k \in \integers^+} \frac{1}{\prob{K \geq k}} \cdot \prob{K=k}
           & \text{by part~\eqref{probKgeqk}}\\
   & = \Theta\paren{\sum_{k \in \integers^+} k^3 \cdot k^{-4}}
            & \text{(by part~\eqref{probKgeqkTheta},~\eqref{Thetamult},~\eqref{Thetasum})}\\
   & = \Theta\paren{\sum_{k \in \integers^+} k^{-1}} = \infty.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
