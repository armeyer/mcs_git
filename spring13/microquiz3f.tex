\begin{problem}
Let $A$ be the set of Albert's arms and legs, $E$ the set of Albert's
eyes, $T$ the set of Albert's toes, and $F$ the set of Albert's
fingers.  For each of the following pairs of sets, write \textbf{B} to
indicate the bij relation holds between them, \textbf{S} to indicate
the surj relation but not the bij relation, and \textbf{I} to indicate
the inj relation but not the bij relation.
