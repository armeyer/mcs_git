\begin{problem}

Prove by the Well Ordering Principle that for all nonnegative integers, $n$: 
\begin{equation}\label{0313n3}
0^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 + \dots + n^3  = \paren{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}^{2}.
\end{equation}

\begin{solution}
The proof is by contradiction.

Suppose to the contrary that equation~\eqref{0313n3} failed for some
$n \geq 0$.  Then by the WOP, there is a \emph{smallest} nonnegative
integer $m$ such this formula does not hold when $n = m$.

But it clearly holds when $n = 0$, which means that $m \geq
1$.  So $m-1$ is nonnegative, and since it is smaller than $m$,
the formula must be true for $n = m-1$.  That is,
\begin{equation}\label{cubesum-to-m-1}
\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} i^3 = \paren{\frac{(m-1)m}{2}}^2.
\end{equation}
Now add $m^3$ to both sides of equation~\eqref{cubesum-to-m-1}.
Then the left-hand side equals
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{m} i^3
\]
and the right-hand side equals
\[
\paren{\frac{(m-1)m}{2}}^2 + m^3 
\]
Now a little algebra %(given below) 
shows that the right-hand side equals
\[
\paren{\frac{m(m+1)}{2}}^2.
\]
That is,
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{m} i^3 = \paren{\frac{m(m+1)}{2}}^2,
\]
contradicting the fact that our formula does not hold for $m$.

\end{solution}
