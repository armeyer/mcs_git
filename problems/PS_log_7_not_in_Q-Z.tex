\begin{problem}
Show that $\log_{7} n$ is either an integer or irrational, where $n$ is a
positive integer.  Use whatever familiar facts about integers and primes
you need, but explicitly state such facts.  (This problem will be graded
on the clarity and simplicity of your proof.  If you can't figure out how
to prove it, ask the staff for help and they'll tell you how.)

\solution{The statement to be proved is equivalent to the assertion that, for
all positive integers, $n$, if $\log_7 n$ is rational, then it is an
integer.

So we'll assume
\begin{equation}\label{ij}
\log_7 n = \frac{i}{j}
\end{equation}
for some integers, $i,j$.  Now if $i=0$, then $\log_7 n$ is the integer
0, so we can asssume $i>0$ and $n>1$.  Using the fact that $\log_7 x$
is positive for $x>1$, we can conclude that $j> 0$, also.

Now, raising $7$ to the power $\log_7 n$, we have from~\eqref{ij}
\[
n  = 7^{\log_7 n} = 7^{i/j}.
\]
Then, taking $j$th powers,
\begin{equation}\label{nj}
n^j =(7^{i/j})^j =  7^i.
\end{equation}
Since $i,j >0$, both sides of equation~\eqref{nj} are integers.  Also,
since the only prime dividing the righthand of~\eqref{nj} is 7,
\emph{the fact that integers factor uniquely into primes} implies that the
only prime factor of $n^j$, and hence the only prime factor of $n$, is 7.
This means that $n$ can only be a nonnegative power of 7, so $\log_7 n$
must be a nonnegative integer.}
