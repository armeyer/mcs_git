\begin{problem}  %revised from fall 05 ps1:

If a set, $A$, is finite, then $\card{A} < 2^{\card{A}} =
\card{\power(A)}$, and so there is no bijection from $\power(A)$ to $A$.
Show that this is still true if $A$ is infinite.  \hint Remember Russell's
paradox and consider
\[
\set{f(B) \in A \suchthat B \subseteq A\text{ and }f(B) \notin B}
 \]
where $f$ is such a bijection.

\solution{We prove there is no bijection by contradiction: suppose there
was a bijection $f: \power(A) \to A$ for some set $A$.  Because $f$ is a
bijection, for any element $a \in A$ there is a unique subset $B_a
\subseteq A$ such that $f(B_a) =a$.  So consider the set 
\[
W \eqdef \set{a \in A \suchthat a \notin B_a} .
\]  
By the definition of this set, we know that for all $a \in A$:
\begin{equation}\label{xw}
(a \in W) \iff (a \notin B_a) .
\end{equation}
But $W \subseteq A$ (by the definition of $W$), and hence $W$ is a member
of $\power(A)$.  So $f(W) \in A$ and $W=B_{f(W)}$.  So we have
from~\eqref{xw}, that
\begin{equation}\label{xf}
(a \in B_{f(W)}) \iff (a \notin B_a)
\end{equation}
for all $a \in A$.  Substituting $f(W)$ for $a$ in~\eqref{xf} yields a
contradiction, proving that there cannot be such an $f$.}
