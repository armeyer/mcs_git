\begin{problem}
What is $\rem{24^{78}}{79}$? \hint 79 is prime.  You should not need
to do any calculation!  

\begin{solution}
\textbf{1}.

Fermat's Little Theorem says that $n^{p-1}$ is congruent to 1 modulo
$p$, and hence $\rem{n^{p-1}}{p} = 1$, when $p$ is prime and $n$ is
not divisible by $p$.  Since 79 is prime and $24^{78}$ is not
divisible by 79, the answer follows.
\end{solution}
