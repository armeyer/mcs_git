\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: The Divisibility DAG

In this DAG (Figure ~\ref{fig:divi2}) for the divisibility relation on
$\set{1, \dots, 12}$, there is an upward path from $a$ to~$b$ iff $a
\divides b$.  If 24 was added as a vertex, what is the minimum number
of edges that must be added to the DAG to represent divisibility on
$set{1, \dots, 12, 24}$?  What are those edges?

\begin{solution}
2

Edges from 8 and 12 to 24 are all that are needed.
\end{solution}
