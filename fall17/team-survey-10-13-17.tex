\paper{team-surveyOctober13}{}{Team Survey}

This is an \textbf{optional, anonymous} survey.  The team coaches have been
instructed to turn the surveys in to an Instructor without looking
them over.  The Instructors will also not look them over, but will
turn them over to the class secretary who will collate and report the
results.

You are free to skip any of the questions.  In particular, you \textbf{need
not identify your team}, but we can provide better feedback and help if
you do.
