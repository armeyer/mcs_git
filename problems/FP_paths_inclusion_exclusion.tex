\bparts

\ppart\label{002020paths} Theory Hippo wants to travel from point
(0, 0) to point (32, 43) using only steps that add one to the $x$ or
the $y$ coordinate.  Write a simple formula for the number of paths he
can follow.  (You may leave factorials and binomial coefficients in
your solutions.  No explanation is required.)

\exambox{1.0in}{0.7in}{0.0in}
\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{32+43}{32} = \frac{75!}{32!\ 43!}
\]
He must choose 32 of 75 steps to increment $x$ and the remaining 43 to
increment $y$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Theory Hippo still wants to travel from point (0, 0) to point
(32, 43). But he learns there are Bottomless Pits of Utter Annihilation
at points (11, 11) and (21, 17) through which paths cannot pass.  How
many paths are there for Theory Hippo to follow?

\hint Ignoring the pits, let $S$ be the set of
paths from (0, 0) to (32, 43) that go through (11,11), and
let $T$ be the ones that go through (21,17).

\exambox{5.0in}{0.7in}{0.0in}

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{75}{32} - 
\binom{22}{11} \cdot \binom{53}{21} - \binom{38}{17} \cdot \binom{37}{26}
+ \binom{22}{11} \cdot \binom{16}{6} \cdot \binom{37}{11}.
\]

The set of paths that are blocked by some pit is $S \union T$.  By
Inclusion-Exclusion,
\begin{align}
\card{S \union T}
   & = \card{S} + \card{T} - \Card{S \intersect T}\notag\\
   & = \binom{22}{11} \cdot \binom{53}{21} + \binom{38}{17} \cdot \binom{37}{26}\notag\\
   & \quad - \binom{22}{11} \cdot \binom{16}{6} \cdot \binom{37}{11}.\label{binST}
\end{align}

Consequently, the number of paths that do not cross a Bottomless Pit of
Utter Annihilation is the number $\binom{75}{32}$ from
part~\eqref{002020paths} of possible paths, minus~\eqref{binST}.

\end{solution}
