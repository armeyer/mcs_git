\begin{problem} 
Suppose the precedence constraints on a set of 32 unit time tasks was
isomorphic to the powerset, $\power(\set{1,2,3,4,5})$ under the strict
subset relation $\subset$.

For example, the task corresponding to the set $\set{2,4}$ must be
completed before the task corresponding to the set $\set{1, 2, 4}$
because $\set{2,4} \subset \set{1,2,4}$; the task corresponding to the
empty set must be scheduled first because $\emptyset \subset S$ for
every nonempty set $S \subseteq \set{1,2,3,4,5}$.

\bparts

\ppart What is the minimum parallel time to complete these
tasks?\hfill\examrule[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
\textbf{6 time units}.

One maximum length chain is $\emptyset, \set{1}, \set{1,2}, \set{1,2,3},
\set{1,2,3,4}, \set{1,2,3,4,5}$.  There are altogether 120 such chains
determined by the permutations of $\Zintv{1}{5}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Describe a maximum size antichain in this partial order.

\examspace[0.7in]

\begin{solution}
  The size 2 subsets of $\Zintv{1}{5}$ are a maximum antichain, and there are 10
  such subsets.

 The size 3 subsets are another maximum size antichain.
\end{solution}

\ppart Briefly explain why the minimum number of processors required to
complete these tasks in minimum parallel time is equal to the size of the
maximum antichain.

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
We know the size of the maximum antichain is always sufficient.

No smaller number is possible in this case since all the size 2 subsets
must be scheduled at time 3 in a minimum time schedule because each of
them is the third element in a maximum size chain.
\end{solution}
