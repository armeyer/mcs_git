%In this problem we explore a variation of the famous Monty Hall Problem. The set up will be as follows:
%
%Suppose you are on a game show, and are given the choice of three doors, A, B, and C. Behind one door is a car and behind the other two doors are goats. The car is equally likely to be hidden behind each of the three doors. You pick a door. If you have selected the door that hides the car, the host will open one of the remaining doors (with equal probability) and offer you to switch doors. This is just as in the original Monty Hall problem.
%
%Otherwise, if you pick a door without the car, the host will do one of two things:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item With probability 0.5 the host will immediately open the door that you have selected, revealing a goat. In this case you will always lose.
%\item With probability 0.5 he will open the other door that does not contain the car. The host will then give you the opportunity to switch doors.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%After this is completed, the door you selected is opened. If that car is hidden behind it, you win a car! Otherwise you lose.

\begin{problem}{20}
In the far off land of Spain two soccer teams: Barcelona and Madrid have been battling each other for centuries to see who is more awesome. They play two games a year: one in the Spring and one in the Fall. The Madrid team has a tendency to fire their coaches very often to try to improve their results. The outcomes of the games are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If Madrid has not just fired their coach:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Barcelona wins with probability $\frac25$
\item
Madrid wins with probability $\frac25$
\item
They tie with probability $\frac15$
\end{itemize}
\item
If Madrid has just fired their coach (they haven't yet realized that it's a bad idea):
\begin{itemize}
\item
Barcelona wins with probability $\frac35$
\item
Madrid wins with probability $\frac15$
\item
They tie with probability $\frac15$
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Now, Madrid does not fire their coach if they win or tie, but if Barcelona wins, they will fire their coach with $90\%$ probability.
For the following two questions, assume that Madrid did not fire their coach before the Spring 2010 game.

%\begin{problem}{20}
%In class, we have shown that the congestion of a butterfly network is $\sqrt{N}$. In this problem, we will analyze the expected number of packages going through a specific switch in the network. Recall that if you look at the switch in the $i-th$ layer of the network and represent it's position in that layer as a binary number $(y_1y_2\ldots y_ix_{i+1}x_{i+1}\ldots x_{n})$ where $N=2^n$, then the packets going through that switch are the ones where the output starts with $y_1y_2\ldots y_i$ in binary AND the input ends with $x_{i+1}x_{i+1}\ldots x_{n}$ in binary.
%Assume you are given a random assignment of outputs to inputs. How many packets do you expect to go through a switch in the $i-th$ layer of the network?
%\solution{
%Let $X_j$ be the indicator random variable that the packet from input $j$ goes through our switch and let $E_j$ be the indicator variable that $j$ ends with  $x_{i+1}x_{i+1}\ldots x_{n}$ in binary representation. We have two cases.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%$Pr(X_j=0|E_j=0)=1$.
%\item
%$Pr(X_j=1|E_j=1)=\frac{1}{2^x}$ and $Pr(X_j=0|E_j=1) = 1-frac{1}{2^x}.
%\end{itemize}
%Therefore $Ex(X_j)=\frac{1}{2^x} \cdot E_j.
%Consequently,
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%Ex(number of packets through switch) &=& \sum_{j=0}^{N-1}Ex(X_j)\\
%& = &\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\frac{1}{2^x} \cdot E_j\\
%& = &\frac{1}{2^x}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}E_j\\

{\bf [10 points]}
There is a complete deck of 52 cards, and half of another deck (for a total of 52 + 26 cards) left over. The decks have been mixed together, and repeated cards cannot be told apart. A hand of 5 cards is picked randoly from the shuffled deck and a half.


\ppart {\bf [5 points]} What is the probability that the hand has no identical cards (i.e., cards with the same suit and value. For example, the hand {$\left<Q\heartsuit, 5\spadesuit, 6\spadesuit, 8\clubsuit, Q\heartsuit\right>$} {\em has} identical cards.)?  (you can leave your answer in terms of binomial coefficients)
\vspace{.15in}

We can calculate this probability by calculating
%
\[
\frac{\text{hands with no identical cards}}{\text{total possible hands}}
\]
%

Note there are essentially two families of types (the type of a card is its (suit, number)  pair) of cards: 26 types are repeated in the set and 26 are unique in the set.  We can count the number of possible hands with no identical cards by considering the following cases: the hand is made out of 5 cards of non-repeated types, the hand is made out of 4 cards of non-repeated types in the set and 1 of a repeated type, ... up to the case of all cards are of repeated types. If all cards are from the non repeated kind, there are only $\binom{52}{5}$ possibilities. If all cards are from the repeated types, then we have $\binom{52}{5}\cdot2^5$ hands that could be created. If the hand has $k$ cards from the non-repeated types and $5 - k$ from the repeated types,  then there are $\binom{52}{k}\cdot \binom{52}{5-k} \cdot 2^{5 - k}$ possible hands.

So we get a total count of:

\[
\sum_{i = 0}^5 \binom{52}{k}\cdot \binom{52}{5-k} \cdot 2^{k-5}
\]


Therefore the probability of drawing a hand with no identical cards is:

%
\[
\frac{\sum_{i = 0}^5 \binom{52}{k}\cdot \binom{52}{5-k} \cdot 2^{k-5}}{\binom{78}{5}}
\]
%
\vspace{4 in}

\ppart {\bf [5 points]} What is the probability that the hand has exactly two pairs of identical cards?
\vspace{.15in}

If we have two pairs of identical cards, both pairs will be of the repeated kinds. All possible hands of this type can be concisely described by a tuple $\left( \{T_1, T_2\}, t \right)$ where $\{T_1, T_2\}$ is a set of the two distinct types that appear twice, and $t$ is any leftover card.  There are $\binom{26}{2}$ options for the set, and $52 + 26 - 4 = 74$ options for the third card.

Hence the probability we pick such a hand is:
%
\[
\frac{\binom{26}{2}\cdot 74}{\binom{78}{5}}
\]
