\begin{problem}
Suppose we want to assign pairs of ``buddies,'' who may be of the same gender,
where each person has a preference rank for who they would like to be
buddies with. The meaning of a \emph{stable} buddy assignment is the same as for the familiar (gender segregated) stable matching problem.
% As for the standard (gender segregated) stable matching problem, a buddy assignment is \emph{stable} if there is no \emph{rogue couple}: two people who would both prefer to be buddies with each other than with their assigned partners.
For the preference ranking given in
Figure~\ref{fig:buddy}, show that there is no stable buddy assignment.
In this figure Mergatroid's preferences aren't shown because they
don't affect the outcome.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Some preferences with no stable buddy matching.}
\label{fig:buddy}
\end{figure}

\begin{solution}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:nostablematch}
There is no stable buddy matching among the four people in
Figure~\ref{fig:buddy}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We'll prove this by contradiction.

Assume, for the purposes of contradiction, that there is a stable
matching.  Then there are two members of the love triangle that are
matched.  Since preferences in the triangle are symmetric, we may assume,
in particular, that Robin and Alex are matched.  Then the other pair must
be Bobby-Joe matched with Mergatroid.

But then there is a rogue couple: Alex likes Bobby-Joe best, and Bobby-Joe
prefers Alex to his buddy Mergatroid.  That is, Alex and Bobby-Joe are a
rogue couple, contradicting the assumed stability of the matching.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}
