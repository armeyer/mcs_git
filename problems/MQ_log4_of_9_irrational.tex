\begin{problem}
Prove that $\log_4 9$ is irrational.  Your proof should be clear and
well-organized, and should explicitly indicate where particular
properties of primes are assumed.
 
\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose to the contrary that $\log_4 9 =m/n$ for some integers $m$
  and $n$.  Since $\log_4 9$ is positive, we may assume that $m$ and
  $n$ are also positive.  So we have
\begin{align}
\log_4 9 & = m/n \notag\\
4^{\log_4 9} & = 4^{m/n}  \notag\\
9 &= \paren{4^m}^{1/n} \notag\\
9^n & = 4^m \label{9n4m}
\end{align}
But this is impossible, since left-hand side of~\eqref{9n4m} is odd,
but the right-hand side is even.

This contradiction implies that $\log_4 9$ must be irrational.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
