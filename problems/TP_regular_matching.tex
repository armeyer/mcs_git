\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a 2-colorable simple graph in which every vertex has the
same positive degree.  Explain why $G$ has a perfect matching.

\begin{solution}
Since $G$ is 2-colorable, it is bipartite with $\leftbi{G}$ being the
vertices of one color and $\rightbi{G}$ the vertices of the other
color.  Moreover, since all vertices have the same degree, $G$ is
\emph{degree-constrained}.  Therefore $G$ has a perfect matching by
Theorem~\bref{lem:no_bottleneck_degree_constrained}.
\end{solution}
