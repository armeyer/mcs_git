\begin{problem}
A number is \emph{perfect}\index{perfect number} if it is equal to the
sum of its positive divisors, other than itself.  For example, 6 is
perfect, because $6 = 1 + 2 + 3$.  Similarly, 28 is perfect, because
$28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14$.  Explain why $2^{k-1} (2^k - 1)$ is perfect
when $2^k - 1$ is prime.\footnote{Euclid proved this 2300 years ago.
  About 250 years ago, Euler proved the converse: \emph{every} even
  perfect number is of this form (for a simple proof see
  \href{http://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/EvenPerfect.html}
       {\texttt{http://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/EvenPerfect.html}}).
       It is not known if there are \emph{any} odd perfect numbers at
       all.  It is also not known if there are an infinite number of
       even perfect numbers.  One of the charms of number theory is
       that simple results like those given in this problem lie at the
       brink of the unknown.}

\begin{solution}
If $2^k - 1$ is prime, then the only divisors of $2^{k-1} (2^k - 1)$
are:
\begin{equation}\label{pow2hatk-1}
1,\quad 2,\quad 4,\quad \ldots,\quad 2^{k-1},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{pow2pow2kless1}
1 \cdot (2^k - 1),\quad 2 \cdot (2^k - 1),\quad 4 \cdot (2^k - 1),\quad
   \dots, \quad 2^{k-2} \cdot (2^k - 1).
\end{equation}
The sequence~\eqref{pow2hatk-1} sums to $2^k-1$ (using the formula for
a geometric series),\footnote{It's fun to notice the ``computer
  science'' proof that~\eqref{pow2hatk-1} sums to $2^k-1$.  The
  binary representation of $2^j$ is a \STR{1} followed by
  $j$ \STR{0}'s, so expressed in binary, the sum is
\[
\mathtt{1} + \mathtt{10} + \mathtt{100} +\cdots + \mathtt{1}\underbrace{\mathtt{0}\cdots \mathtt{0}}_{k-1} = \underbrace{\mathtt{1} \cdots \mathtt{1}}_k,
\]
and the right-hand expression is what you get by subtracting
\STR{1} from the binary representation of $2^k$.} and likewise the
sequence~\eqref{pow2pow2kless1} sums to $(2^{k-1} - 1) \cdot (2^k -
1)$.  Adding these two sums gives $2^{k-1} (2^k - 1)$, so the number
is perfect.
\end{solution}
