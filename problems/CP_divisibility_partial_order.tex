\begin{problem}

\ppart
Verify that the divisibilty relation on the set of nonnegative integers is
a weak  partial order.
\begin{solution}

\TBA

\end{solution}

\ppart What about the divisibilty relation on the set of integers?

\begin{solution}
Divisibility is not antisymmetric on the integers, since $n \divides -n$.
\end{solution}
