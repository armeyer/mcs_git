\begin{problem}
How many different ways are there to select an unordered bundle of
four dozen colored roses if red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
and violet roses are available?  Please explain your answer (you may
leave it unsimplified).

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{48+6}{6} \, .
\]

There is a bijection from selections of four dozen roses to
bit-strings with four dozen 0's and six 1's (to delimit the 
numbers of roses of each of the seven colors are chosen).
\end{solution}
