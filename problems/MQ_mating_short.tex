\begin{problem}

In the Mating Ritual, suppose Tiger is one of the boys and Elin is one of the girls.
Which of the following are preserved invariants \textbf{in general}?
\begin{enumerate}

\item Tiger is Elin's only suitor.

\item On Tiger's current list, the girl whom he prefers to all the
  others is his optimal wife\footnote{His \term{optimal wife} in the
    usual sense: Given some particular instance of the Stable Marriage
    Problem, consider all possible stable perfect matchings, including
    that which is generated by the Mating Ritual.  In each of these,
    Tiger has a wife.  Of these ``possible wives,'' he prefers one to
    all others.  This girl, to whom he is married in one of the
    matchings but not necessarily all of them, is his \term{optimal
      wife}.}.

\item Elin's name has been crossed off by Tiger and by everyone whom
  she prefers to him.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
The statements that are preserved invariants in general appear in boldface below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Tiger is Elin's only suitor.  (This would certainly make Tiger
  Elin's favorite that day, but one or more of the boys who got
  rejected by another girl that day may visit Elin the following day.)

\item \textbf{On Tiger's current list, the girl whom he prefers to all
  the others is his optimal wife.}  (The Mating Ritual gives each boy
  his optimal wife.  Tiger must therefore ultimately marry his optimal
  wife, so once she becomes the most preferred girl on his list -- and
  thus the girl he is serenading -- she must remain the top girl on
  his list.)

\item \textbf{Elin's name has been crossed off by Tiger and by
  everyone whom she prefers to him.} (Note that this is a preserved
  invariant because it cannot ever be true.  Were it true on some day,
  Tiger would have crossed Elin's name off his list, so he would end
  up marrying a woman he finds less desirable.  She would also have
  removed from contention everyone she finds more desirable than
  Tiger.  So she would end up marrying someone she finds less
  desirable than Tiger.  Consequently, Tiger and Elin would constitute
  would a rogue couple.  Another way to think about it is this: If
  Elin's name was crossed off by Tiger and all the boys Elin prefers
  to him, then she must have a current favorite whom she prefers to
  all of them.  But Tiger and his betters in Elin's eyes are the top
  boys on her list: there is no one she prefers to them.)
