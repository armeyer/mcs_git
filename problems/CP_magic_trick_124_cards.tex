\begin{problem}

\ppart Show that the Magician could not pull off the trick with a deck larger
than 124 cards.

\hint Compare the number of 5-card hands in an $n$-card deck with the
number of 4-card sequences.

\begin{solution}
For a match to be possible with a $n$-card deck, the number
$\binom{n}{5}$ of 5-card hands must be at most as large as the number
$(n)_4$ of 4-card sequences. So
\[
(n)_4 (n-4)/5! = \binom{n}{5} \leq (n)_4,
\]
which implies
\[
n-4 \leq 5!
\]
and hence $n \leq 124$.

\end{solution}

\ppart Show that, in principle, the Magician could pull off the Card Trick
with a deck of 124 cards.

\hint \idx{Hall's Theorem} and
\idx{degree-constrained}~(\bref{degree-constrained_def}) graphs.

\begin{solution}
In principle the trick is possible iff the bipartite graph
between 5-card hands and 4-card sequences has a matching for the hands.
In this graph, the degree of each hand is $5! = 120$, whatever the size of
deck.  The degree of each sequence of 4 will be the number of cards
remaining in the deck.  With a deck of 124, there will be 120 cards
remaining, so the degree of each sequence of 4 will also be 120.  Hence,
the graph is degree-constrained, and so satisfies Hall's condition for a
matching.
