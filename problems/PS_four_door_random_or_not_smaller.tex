\begin{problem}

Let's see what happens when \emph{\idx{Let's Make a Deal}} is played with
\textbf{four} doors.  A prize is hidden behind one of the four
doors. Then the contestant picks a door.  Next, the host opens an
unpicked door that has no prize behind it.  The contestant is allowed
to stick with their original door or to switch to one of the two
unopened, unpicked doors.  The contestant wins if their final choice
is the door hiding the prize.

Let's also revise our assumptions about how contestants choose doors.
Say the doors are labeled A, B, C, and D.  Suppose that Carol always
opens the \textit{earliest} door possible (the door whose label is
earliest in the alphabet) with the restriction that she can neither
reveal the prize nor open the door that the player picked.

This gives contestant Mergatroid---an engineering student from
Cambridge, MA---just a little more information about the location of
the prize.  Suppose that Mergatroid always switches to the earliest
door, excluding his initial pick and the one Carol opened.

Let's make the same assumptions as in the original problem:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The prize is equally likely to be behind each door.
\item The contestant is equally likely to pick each door initially,
regardless of the prize's location.
\end{enumerate}

Use The \idx{Four Step Method} to find the following probability.
The tree diagram may become awkwardly large, in which case just draw
enough of it to make its structure clear.

What is the probability that Mergatroid wins the prize?

\begin{solution}
A tree diagram is worked out below.
%
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=3.5in]{carol}
\end{center}
%
The probability that Mergatroid wins is:
%
\[
\pr{\text{win}} = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\end{solution}
