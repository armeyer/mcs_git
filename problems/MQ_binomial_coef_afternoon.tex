\begin{problem}

Find the coefficients of $x^4y^{12}$ in $(7x+14y)^{16}$

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{16}{4}7^414^{12}.
\]

When $(7x+14y)^{16}$ is expressed as a sum of powers of the summands
$7x$
and $14y$, the coefficient of $(7x)^4(14y)^{12}$ is $\binom{16}{4}$,
so the
coefficient of $x^4y^{12}$ is this binomial coefficient times
$7^4\cdot 14^{12}$.
\end{solution}
