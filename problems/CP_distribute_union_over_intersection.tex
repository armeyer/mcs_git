\begin{problem}
Prove
\begin{theorem*}[Distributivity of union over intersection]
\begin{equation}\label{AUBIC=}
A \union (B \intersect C) = (A \union B) \intersect (A \union C)
\end{equation}
\end{theorem*}
for all sets, $A, B, C$, by using a chain of iff's to show that
\[
x \in A \union (B \intersect C) \QIFF x \in (A \union B) \intersect (A \union C)
\]
for all elements $x$.  You may assume the corresponding propositional
equivalence\inbook{~\bref{distor}}.

\begin{solution}
Two sets are equal iff they have the same elements, that is, $x$ is in
one set iff $x$ is in the other set, for any $x$.  We'll now prove this
for the two sides of~\eqref{AUBIC=}:

\begin{align*}
\lefteqn{x \in A \union (B \intersect C)}\\
 & \QIFF x \in A\ \QOR\ x \in (B \intersect C)
     & \text{(def of $\union$)}\\
 & \QIFF (x \in A \QOR\ (x \in B\ \QAND\ x \in C) & \text{(by def of $\intersect$)}\\
 & \QIFF P \QOR (Q \QAND R)\\
 &\qquad (\text{where}\ P \eqdef [x \in A],\ Q \eqdef [x \in B],\ R \eqdef [x \in C])\\
 & \QIFF (P \QOR Q) \QAND (P \QOR R)\\
 & \qquad \text{($\QOR$-$\QAND$ distributivity~\bref{distor})}\\%Theorem~\bref{thm:distribute-or-and})}
 & \QIFF (x \in A \QOR\ x \in B) \QAND\ (x \in A \QOR\ x \in C)\\
 & \QIFF (x \in A \union B) \QAND\ (x \in A \union C)
     & \text{(def of $\union$)}\\
 & \QIFF x \in (A \union B) \intersect (A \union C)
     & \text{(def of $\intersect$)}.
\end{align*}

\end{solution}

\begin{staffnotes}
Ask your students if they can now see how a computer could
automatically check such equalities between set formulas involving the
basic set operators like $\union, \intersect, -, \dots$?  The answer
is that proving such equalities reduces to verifying equivalence of
corresponding propositional formulas as above.
