%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Problems start here
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Number Theory: Congruences
\pinput{PS_check_factor_by_digits}  %used in sp12, kinda cute
%\pinput{PS_pulverizer_machine}    %nice review of state machines and preserved invariant. perhaps good CP?
%\pinput{PS_fill_bucket_gcd}
%\pinput{CP_pirate_treasure}     %requires ingenuity, not fundamental            % hooray pirates!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% possible problems that I did not like %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\pinput{PS_induction_mod_proof}        %boring
%\pinput{CP_nonparallel_lines}          %not used in CP sp10, cute but hard to assign partial credit and seems a bit irrelevant
%\pinput{PS_non_unique_factoring}       %used in sp12, dislike
%\pinput{PS_chinese_remainder_general}  %too long; tedious induction from n=2 case
%\pinput{PS_calculating_inverses}       %used in sp11, super easy calculation problem. save for MQ perhaps?

% Number Theory: Euler's Theorem
%\pinput{CP_Sk_equiv_-1_mod_p}          %not used in CP sp10, short, so if the rest of the pset is too long, this could be good
\pinput{PS_order_divides_phi}            %check last used
%\pinput{PS_Euler_function_multiplicativity}    % appeared in F13! also S09; S10(?)
\pinput{PS_Euler_theorem_not_rel_prime}

% Number Theory: RSA
%\pinput{TP_RSA_reversed}               %S12, to easy for PS
%\pinput{PS_RSA_key_implies_factoring}  %too many unproved facts needed
%\pinput{PS_Rabin_cryptosystem}         %too many unproved facts needed
