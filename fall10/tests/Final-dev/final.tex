If you have selected the door that hides the prize, the host will always open one of the remaining doors (and he chooses among these doors at random, i.e. he is equally likely to open either door) and then will always offer you the possibility to switch doors. Otherwise, with probability 0.5 the host will open immediately the door that you have selected (revealing that you have lost) and with probability 0.5 he will open the other door that does not hide the prize. In the latter case he will always give you the opportunity to switch doors. After your decision on whether to switch, the door that you have selected in the end is opened to see whether the prize is hidden behind it, in which case you will win the prize.
What is the probability of winning if:
(b) Initially you select door 3 and you always switch if you are offered the opportunity to switch.
(c) Initially you select door 3 and if the host opens door 2 you switch otherwise you stick with door 3.

Monty hall variation, obtained from:

There are four cards face down - two are Jacks, two are Queens. There is a host present who knows what each card is. 

1.You choose one of the cards.

2a.You instruct the host to eliminate either a Jack or a Queen. It is your decision. You can flip a coin if you wish. He will follow your instructions and turn over one of the other three cards accordingly.

2b. Alternatively, the host is not involved. You simply turn over one of the cards yourself. 

3. Whichever way it happened, let us say a Jack was eliminated.

4. At this point, you make a new selection. You can stick to your original card or choose one of the other two.

5. Finally, another card is eliminated. This time it must be the host who turns it over. He will show the opposite of the last so as not to spoil the game. In this case, he turns over a Queen.

There is now one Jack and and one Queen remaining. Your card is one of them.

Questions: Which is more likely to be the Queen? Are the odds 50/50? Does it make a difference whether you stuck or swapped? Does it make a difference whether you used the host for the first elimination?

A chessboard is covered with tetris blocks (each covers 4 fields). Prove that there is an even number of black fields on that chessboard.
\solution{Number of fields divisible by $4$. Two cases: both sides even length or one side with length divisible by $4$.}
\solution{By contradiction. If both sides odd, then total number fields odd, but it must be divisible by 4, so contradiction.}

Now consider a specific case when all the tetris blocks used are of the shape in the figure below. Prove that the number of fields on the chessboard is divisible by $8$.
\solution{(Sketch) Each block covers $3$ black and $1$ white or $1$ black and $3$ white fields. Show by induction that an odd number of blocks covers an odd number of black fields. Number of black fields is even, so need an even number of blocks. Each of them is of size $4$, so they cover a multiple of $8$ fields.}

In the far off land of Spain two teams: Barcelona and Madrid have been battling each other for centuries to see who is more awesome. They play two games a year: one in the Spring and one in the Fall. The Madrid team has a tendency to fire their coaches very often to try to improve their results. The outcomes of the games are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If Madrid has not just fired their coach:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Barcelona wins with probability $\frac25$
\item
Madrid wins with probability $\frac25$
\item
They tie with probability $\frac15$
\end{itemize}
\item
If Madrid has just fired their coach (they haven't yet realized that it's a bad idea):
\begin{itemize}
\item
Barcelona wins with probability $\frac35$
\item
Madrid wins with probability $\frac15$
\item
They tie with probability $\frac15$
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Now, Madrid does not fire their coach if they win or tie, but if Barcelona wins, they will fire their coach with $90\%$ probability.
For the following two questions, assume that Madrid did not fire their coach before the Spring 2010 game.

In class, we have shown that the congestion of a butterfly network is $\sqrt{N}$. In this problem, we will analyze the expected number of packages going through a specific switch in the network. Recall that if you look at the switch in the $i-th$ layer of the network and represent it's position in that layer as a binary number $(y_1y_2\ldots y_ix_{i+1}x_{i+1}\ldots x_{n})$ where $N=2^n$, then the packets going through that switch are the ones where the output starts with $y_1y_2\ldots y_i$ in binary AND the input ends with $x_{i+1}x_{i+1}\ldots x_{n}$ in binary.
Assume you are given a random assignment of outputs to inputs. How many packets do you expect to go through a switch in the $i-th$ layer of the network?
\solution{
Let $X_j$ be the indicator random variable that the packet from input $j$ goes through our switch and let $E_j$ be the indicator variable that $j$ ends with  $x_{i+1}x_{i+1}\ldots x_{n}$ in binary representation. We have two cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$Pr(X_j=0|E_j=0)=1$.
\item
$Pr(X_j=1|E_j=1)=\frac{1}{2^x}$ and $Pr(X_j=0|E_j=1) = 1-frac{1}{2^x}.
\end{itemize}
Therefore $Ex(X_j)=\frac{1}{2^x} \cdot E_j.
Consequently,
\begin{eqnarray*}
Ex(number of packets through switch) &=& \sum_{j=0}^{N-1}Ex(X_j)\\
& = &\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\frac{1}{2^x} \cdot E_j\\
& = &\frac{1}{2^x}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}E_j\\
& = &\frac{1}{2^x} \cdot (number of inputs that start with $x_{i+1}x_{i+1}\ldots x_{n}$ in binary representation)\\
& = &\frac{1}{2^x} \cdot 2^x\\
& = & 1.

A balanced hand is one in which a player has roughly the same number of cards in each suit. How many different hands are there where the player has $4$ cards in one suit and $3$ cards in each of the other suits?
\solution{There are $4$ suits to pick from for the longest suit, $4$ cards out of $13$ to choose from in that suit, and $3$ cards out of $13$ to choose from in each of the remaining $3$ suits.
This gives

such hands.}

Not surprisingly, a non-balanced hand is one in which a player has more cards in some suits than others. Hands that are very disired are ones where over half the cards are in one suit. How many different hands are there where there is exactly $7$ cards in one suit?
\solution{
There are $4$ suits to choose from for the long suit, $7$ cards out of $13$ to choose in that suit, and $6$ cards out of the remaining $39$ in the other $3$ suits. This gives

{There are $2$ ways to correctly color each component, and there are $k$ components, so there is $2^k$ valid colorings. The number of colorings you might produce is $2^n$ and each is equallly likely. The probability that you get a valid coloring is

Graph G is built as follows: first, a complete graph $G_n$ with $n$ vertices is created, then a complete graph $G_m$ is created. After this, a random node $u$ from $G_n$ and a random node $v$ from $G_m$ are selected and connected by an edge. This is where you come in. You select $k$ random nodes from $G$ ($k<n$ and $k<m$) and connect them by all the edges between them that are in $G$. What is the probability that the graph you created has only one connected component?
\solution{
The ways to select a connected graph are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Select nodes $u$ and $v$ and then any $k-2$ of the remaining $m+n-2$ nodes. There are \[\choose{m+n-2}{k-2}\] ways of doing this.
\item
Do not select both $u$ and $v$. Then the only way to get a connected graph is to have all nodes either from $G_m$ or $G_n$. That gives us
\[\binom{m}{k}+\binom{n}{k}\]
ways.
\end{enumerate}
The total number of ways to select $k$ nodes is \[\binom{m+n}{k}.\]
This means the probability of getting a connected graph is
\[\frac{\binom{m+n-2}{k-2}+\binom{m}{k}+\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{m+n}{k}}.\]

Two identical complete decks of cards, each with 52 cards, have been mixed together. A hand of 5 cards is picked uniformly at random from amongst all subsets of exactly 5 cards.
\bparts
\ppart {\bf [5 points]} What is the probability that the hand has no identical cards (i.e., cards with the same suit and value. For example, the hand {$\left<Q\heartsuit, 5\spadesuit, 6\spadesuit, 8\clubsuit, Q\heartsuit\right>$} {\em has} identical cards.)?
\vspace{.15in}
We can calculate this probability by computing
%
\[
\frac{\text{hands with no identical cards}}{\text{total possible hands}}
\]
%
There are 104 cards.  There are 5 cards in a hand.  Order does not matter.  The total number of possible hands is:

$\binom{104}{5}$

There are 52 possible card faces, and we can choose 5 of them if no identical cards are allowed.  Additionally, each card can be from either deck 1 or deck 2.  Therefore the number of hands with no identical cards, chosen from 2 decks is:
%
\[
\binom{52}{5} \cdot 2^5
\]
%

Therefore the probability of drawing a hand with no identical cards is:

%
\[
\frac{\binom{52}{5} \cdot 2^5}{\binom{104}{5}}
\]
%

\ppart {\bf [5 points]} What is the probability that the hand has exactly one pair of identical cards?
\vspace{.15in}
This can be solved by a similar approach.  A hand of this type can be distinguished by the face (suit and value) of the repeated card, and by the faces of the 3 non-repeated cards.  There are 52 possible values for the face of the repeated card.  There are $\binom{51}{3}$ possible faces for the non-repeated cards, since none of these can be repeated.  Each of these could come from either the 1st deck or the 2nd deck.  There are  $\binom{104}{5}$ possible hands, as before.  So the probability of getting a hand with exactly one pair of identical cards is:

%
\[
\frac{52 \cdot \binom{51}{3} \cdot 2^3}{\binom{104}{5}}
\]
