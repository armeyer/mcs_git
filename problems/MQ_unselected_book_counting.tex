\begin{problem}
Suppose $n$ books are lined up on a shelf.  The number of selections
of $m$ of the books so that selected books are separated by at least
three unselected books is the same as the number of \emph{all}
length $k$ binary strings with exactly $m$ ones.

\bparts

\ppart  What is the value of $k$? \hfill \examrule[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
\[
k = n-3(m-1).
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Describe a bijection between between the set of all length $k$
binary strings with exactly $m$ ones and such book selections.

\begin{solution}
A selection of $m$ among $n$ books on a shelf corresponds in an
obvious way to a length $n$ binary string with exactly $m$ ones.  So
we need a bijection from length $k$ strings with $m$ ones to
length $n$ strings with $m$ one's that are at least three apart.
Such a bijection is defined by replacing each of the first $m-1$ ones
in the length $k$ string by \STR{1000}.

\iffalse
So the problem reduces to finding a bijection
such between $n$-bit strings where consecutive \STR{1}'s separated
by at least 3 \STR{0}', and bit strings of length $n-3(m-1)$ with
$k$ \STR{1}'s.  The bijection is defined by mapping a 

But in a string $s$ with $k$ \STR{1}'s that are at least 3 apart,
all but the last \STR{1} must have a \STR{000} to its right.  So
we can map $s$ to a string with $k$ \STR{1}'s and $3(k-1)$ fewer
\STR{0}'s by erasing the \STR{000}'s immediately to the right of
each of the first $k-1$ \STR{1}'s.

This map is a bijection because given any $(n-3(k-1))$-bit string with
$k$ \STR{1}'s, there is a unique $n$-bit string with \STR{1}'s
that are at least 3 apart that maps to it, namely, the string obtained
by replacing each of the first $k-1$ \STR{1}'s in the
$(n-3(k-1))$-bit string by a \STR{1000}.
