\begin{problem}
  Express each of the following predicates and propositions in formal
  logic notation.  The domain of discourse is the nonnegative integers,
  $\naturals$.  Moreover, in addition to the propositional operators,
  variables and quantifiers, you may define predicates using addition,
  multiplication, and equality symbols, and nonnegative integer
  \emph{constants} \mtt{0}, \mtt{1},\dots), biut no \emph{exponentiation}
  (like $x^y$).  For example, the predicate ``n is an even number''
  could be defined by either of the following formulas:
\[
\exists m.\; (2m = n), \qquad \exists m.\; (m + m = n).
\]

\begin{problemparts}
\iffalse
\problempart 
$n$ is the sum of two cubes (a cube is a number equal to $k^3$ for some
integer $k$).

\begin{solution}
\[
\exists x \exists y.\; (x \cdot x \cdot x + y \cdot y \cdot y = n)
\]

Since the constant 0 is not allowed to appear explicitly, the predicate
``$x = 0$'' can't be written directly, but note that it could be expressed
in a simple way as:
\[
x + x = x.
\]
Then the predicate $x > y$ could be expressed
\[
\exists w.\; (y + w = x) \land (w \neq 0).
\]
Note that we've used ``$w \neq 0$'' in this formula, even though it's
technically not allowed.  But since ``$w \neq 0$'' is equivalent to the
allowed formula ``$\neg(w+w= w)$,'' we can use ``$w \neq 0$'' with the
understanding that it abbreviates the real thing.  And now that we've shown
how to express ``$x>y$,'' it's ok to use it too.
\end{solution}

\problempart $x = 1$.

\begin{solution}
One formula is $\forall y.\; xy=y$.  Another is $(x \cdot x = x) \conj (x
\neq 0)$.
\end{solution}
\fi

\ppart $m$ is a divisor of $n$ (notation: $m \divides n$)

\begin{solution}
\[
m \divides n 
\eqdef\quad 
\exists k.\; k \cdot m = n
\]
\end{solution}

\problempart 
$n$ is a prime number.

\begin{solution}
\[
\isprime(n)
\eqdef\quad 
(n\neq 1)\ \QAND\ \forall m.\; (m \divides n) \QIMPLIES (m=1 \QOR m=n).
\]
Note that $n\neq 1$ is an abbreviation of the formula $\QNOT(n=1)$.
\end{solution}

\problempart 
$n$ is a power of a prime.

\begin{solution}
  We can say that there is a prime, $p$, such that every divisor of
  $n$ not equal to is itself divisible by $p$.
\[
\exist p.\,[\isprime(p) \QAND \forall m.\; (m \divides n \QAND m \neq 1)
\QIMPLIES p \divides m].
\]
\end{solution}
