\section*{Pairwise Independent Sampling}

\begin{theorem*}[Pairwise Independent Sampling]
Let $G_1, \dots, G_n$ be pairwise independent variables with the same
mean, $\mu$, and deviation, $\sigma$.  Define
\[
S_n \eqdef \sum_{i=1}^n G_i.
\]
Then
\[
\pr{\abs{\frac{S_n}{n} - \mu} \geq x}
    \leq \frac{1}{n} \paren{\frac{\sigma}{x}}^2.
\]
\end{theorem*}
