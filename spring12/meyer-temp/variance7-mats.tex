\begin{problem}
Suppose you flip a fair coin 100 times.  The coin flips are all
mutually independent.  What is an upper bound on the probability that
the number of heads is at least 70\ldots
\begin{problemparts}

\problempart
\dots according to Markov's Inequality?

\begin{solution}
The expected number of heads of $50$.  So the probability that the
number of heads is at least $70$ is at most $50/70 = 0.71$.
\end{solution}

\problempart
\dots according to Chebyshev's Inequality?

\begin{solution}
Let $X_i$ be the random variable whose value is $1$ if the $i$th coin
flip is heads.  Then $\Var[X_i] = 1/2 - (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.  So $\Var[X_1
+ \cdots + X_100] = 100/4 = 25$.  The variance of the number of heads
is $100/4 = 25$, so the standard deviation is $5$.  So $70$ is four
times the standard deviation from the mean.  Since the distribution is
symmetric, the probability is at most $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4^2}
= \frac{1}{32}$
\end{solution}

\problempart
\dots according to Chernoff's Bound?

\begin{solution}

We apply Chernoff`s bound with $c = 70/50 = 1.4$.  This gives us that
$\alpha = \ln(1.4) + 1/1.4 - 1 = 0.05076$ and that the probability is
at most $e^{-0.05076 \cdot 1.4 \cdot 50} = 0.0286$.

\end{solution}
