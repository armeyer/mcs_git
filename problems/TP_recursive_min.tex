\begin{problem}
Suppose every tree $T \in \rectr$ has a numerical label $\nlbl{(T)} \in
\reals$.  The \emph{minimum value} in $\text{min}(T)$ is defined to be
the smallest label among its subtrees.  The function
\[
\rmin{}: \rectr \to \reals
\]
is recursively defined as follows:

\inductioncase{Base case}: ($T$ is a leaf).
\[
\rmin{(T)} \eqdef \nlbl{(T)}.
\]

\inductioncase{Constructor case}: ($T \in \brnchng$)
\[
\rmin{(T)} \eqdef \min\set{\nlbl{(T)}, \rmin{(\leftsub{(T)})}, \rmin{(\rightsub{(T)})}}
\]

Prove that
\[
\rmin{(T)} = \text{min}(T)
\]
for all $T \in \rectr$.
\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}
The proof is by structural induction on the definition of \rmin{}.
