\begin{problem}

Suppose that a gambler is playing a game in which he makes a series of
\$1 bets.  He wins each one with probability 0.49, and he keeps
betting until he either runs out of money or reaches some fixed goal
of $T$ dollars.

Let $t(n)$ be the expected number of \emph{bets} the gambler makes
until the game ends, where $n$ is the number of dollars the gambler
has when he starts betting.  Then the function $t$ satisfies a linear
recurrence of the form
\begin{equation*}
t(n) = a \cdot t(n+1) + b \cdot t(n-1) + c
\end{equation*}
for real constants $a$, $b$, $c$, and $0 < n < T$.

\bparts

\ppart
What are the values of $a$, $b$ and $c$?

\begin{solution}
0.49, 0.51, 1 respectively.  So the recurrence is:
\begin{equation*}
t(n) = 0.49 t(n+1) + 0.51 t(n-1) + 1
\end{equation*}
\end{solution}

\ppart
What is $t(0)$?

\begin{solution}
0
\end{solution}

\ppart
What is $t(T)$?

\begin{solution}
0
\end{solution}
