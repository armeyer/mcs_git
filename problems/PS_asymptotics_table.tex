\begin{problem}
  Indicate which of the following holds for each pair of functions $(f(n),
  g(n))$ in the table below.  Assume $k\geq 1$, $\epsilon > 0$, and $c >
  1$ are constants.  Pick the four table entries you consider to be the
  most challenging or interesting and justify your answers to these.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{|cc|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
f(n) & g(n) & 
f = O(g) & f=o(g) & 
g = O(f) & g=o(f) & 
f = \Theta(g) & f\sim g 
\\\hline\hline
2^n & 2^{n/2} & & & & & & \\\hline
\sqrt{n} & n^{\sin n\pi/2} & & & & & & \\\hline
\log(n!) & \log(n^n) & & & & & & \\\hline
n^k & c^n & & & & & & \\\hline
\log^k n & n^\epsilon & & & & & & \\\hline

Following are some hints on deriving the table above:

\begin{itemize}

\item[(a)] 
$\dfrac{2^n}{2^{n/2}}=2^{n/2}$ grows without bound as $n$
grows---it is not bounded by a constant.

\item[(b)] 
When $n$ is even, then $n^{\sin n\pi/2}=1$.  So, no constant times
$n^{\sin n\pi/2}$ will be an upper bound on $\sqrt n$ as $n$ ranges
over even numbers.  When $n \equiv 1 \bmod 4$, then $n^{\sin n\pi/2}=
n^1 =n$. So, no constant times $\sqrt n$ will be an upper bound on
$n^{\sin n\pi/2}$ as $n$ ranges over numbers $\equiv 1 \bmod 4$.

\item[(c)] 
\begin{eqnarray}
\log(n!) & = & \log \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n \pm
c_n\label{logS}\\
& = & \log n + n(\log n - 1) \pm d_n \label{logprod}\\
& \sim & n \log n\label{sim}\\
& = & \log n^n.\notag
\end{eqnarray}
where $a \leq c_n,d_n \leq b$ for some constants $a,b \in \reals$ and all
$n$.  Here equation~(\ref{logS}) follows by taking logs of Stirling's
formula,~(\ref{logprod}) follows from the fact that the log of a product
is the sum of the logs, and~(\ref{sim}) follows because any constant,
$\log n$, and $n$ are all $o(n \log n)$ and hence so is their sum.

\iffalse

\dots follows\textbf{from Problem~\ref{o+o}, part~\ref{f+o} because any
constant, $\log n$, and $n$ are all $o(n \log n)$.}
\fi

\item[(d)] 
\emph{Polynomial} growth versus \emph{exponential} growth.

\item[(e)] 
\emph{Polylogarithmic} growth versus \emph{polynomial} growth. 

\end{itemize}
