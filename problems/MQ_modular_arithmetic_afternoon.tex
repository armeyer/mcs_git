Prove that $33^{60001}$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo 
175.

\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}
Since $\gcd(33^{60001},175) = \gcd(33,175) = 
       \gcd(3 \cdot 11,5^{2} \cdot 7) =
       1$, $33^{60001}$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo 175.
}
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the value of $\phi(175)$, where $\phi$ is Euler's
function?

\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}


Noting that $175=5^2\cdot 7$.  It follows
that $\phi(175)=(5^2 - 5^1)(7-1)= 20 \cdot 6 =120$.
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the remainder of $33^{60001}$ divided by 175?

\begin{solution}Since 33 and 175 are relatively prime, we have by Euler's
Theorem that $33^{120} \equiv 1 \pmod {175}$, and so
\[
33^{60001} = \paren{33^{120}}^{500}\cdot 33 \equiv 1^{500}\cdot 33 \equiv 33 \pmod {175}.
\]
\end{solution}
