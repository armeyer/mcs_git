Jodie: This (very) shortened problem from a 6.046 pset from last year that I
think would be good for bipartite matching:

ARM: Too much story to wade through.  Also undesirable to use new
concept like Maximum Matching on a final exam.

\end{staffnotes}

\begin{problem}
Alyssa has recently acquired a large number of sentry turrets 1 from
the Aperture Science surplus store. She plants to use them for a
surprise attack on Bob's castle, which has a very simple shape - it is
just an $N \times M$ grid.  Some of the cells are lava-pits, so Alyssa
can only teleport turrets into some of the $N \times M$ cells.  A
turret located in a cell on row i at column j can (and will) attack
anything in the same row or on the same column.  Specifically, if two
turrets can see each other, they will attack each other.  Alyssa wants
to teleport the maximum number of turrets into the castle, while
avoiding ``friendly fire'' situations (when two turrets attack each
other).  Consider a bipartite graph derived from the setup above: each
row will be a vertex in the left subset and each column will be vertex
in the right subset.  Finish the construction of the graph in such a
way that the maximum matching in the resulting graph equals to the
maximum number of turrets that Alyssa can teleport on the grid, and
explain why it works.

Solution: In the left subset we have vertices for all of the rows and
in the right subset we have vertices for all of the columns.  An
intuitive way to connect the rows and columns is to add an edge where
they intersect. We will add an edge between a row and a column only if
their common cell is not a lava pit.  With maximum matching on this
graph, we will match certain rows with certain columns. If we match a
row and a column, this corresponds to teleporting a turret in the cell
of their common cell.  What does the constraints of the matching
problem tell us?  We can match a vertex from left side to at most one
vertex of the right side and we can match a vertex from the right side
with at most one vertex from the left side.  A match in our problem
corresponds to teleporting a turret, so we can teleport at most one
turret on every row and on every column.  Given this setup, the
problem that we want to solve is given a bipartite graph what is the
maximum number of vertices from the left side that we can match with
vertices from the right side.  The answer to this is just the maximum
matching in this graph.
\end{problem}

Subsumed by {MQ\_expectHH\_TT}:

We know that CP\_coin\_flips was used in a class problem.  However, we
think that it can be changed such that the coin flips used for winning
are different, or longer sequences are needed to win.
