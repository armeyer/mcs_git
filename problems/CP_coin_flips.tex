\begin{problem}
  To determine which of two people gets a prize, a coin is flipped twice.
  If the flips are a Head and then a Tail, the first player wins.  If the
  flips are a Tail and then a Head, the second player wins.  However, if
  both coins land the same way, the flips don't count and the whole
  process starts over.

  Assume that on each flip, a Head comes up with probability $p$,
  regardless of what happened on other flips.  Use the four step method to
  find a simple formula for the probability that the first player wins.
  What is the probability that neither player wins?

  \hint The tree diagram and sample space are infinite, so you're not
  going to finish drawing the tree.  Try drawing only enough to see a
  pattern.  Summing all the winning outcome probabilities directly is
  cumbersome.  However, a neat trick solves this problem---and many
  others.  Let $s$ be the sum of all winning outcome probabilities in
  the whole tree.  Notice that \emph{you can write the sum of all the
    winning probabilities in certain subtrees as a function of $s$}.
  Use this observation to write an equation in $s$ and then solve.

\begin{solution}
In the tree diagram below, the small triangles represent
subtrees that are themselves complete copies of the whole tree.

Let $s$ equal the sum of all winning probabilities in the whole tree.
There are two extra edges with probability $p$ on the path to each
outcome in the top subtree.  Therefore, the sum of winning
probabilities in the upper tree is $p^2 s$.  Similarly, the sum of
winning probabilities in the lower subtree is $(1-p)^2 s$.  This gives
the equation:

\begin{equation*}
s = p^2 s + (1-p)^2 s + p (1-p)
\end{equation*}

The solution to this equation is $s = 1/2$, for all $p$ between 0 and
1.

By symmetry, the probability that the first player loses is 1/2.  This
means that the event, if any, of flipping forever can only have
probability zero.

Formally, the sample space is the (infinite) set of leaves of the tree,
namely,
\[
\sspace \eqdef \set{\mathtt{TT,HH}}^*\cdot \set{\mathtt{HT,TH}}
\]
where $\set{\mathtt{TT,HH}}^*$ denotes the set of strings formed by
concatenating a sequence of \texttt{HH}'s and \texttt{TT}'s.  For example,
\[
\mathtt{TTTTHHHT, HHTTTH, HHHHHHHHHT, HT} \in \sspace.
\]
For any string $s \in \sspace$,
\[
\pr{s} \eqdef p^{\text{\#\texttt{H}'s in $s$}}(1-p)^{\text{\#\texttt{T}'s in $s$}}.
\]
To verify that is defines a probability space, we must show that
$\sum_{s \in \sspace} \pr{s} = 1$.  The probability that two
tosses match is $p^2 + (1-p)^2$, and that they don't match is
$2p(1-p)$. Thus, the probability of getting matching tosses for the first $2n$ coins
and finally getting differing tosses on the last 2 coins is 
$$\pr{\text{Succeeding after $2n+2$ tosses}} = (p^2 + (1-p)^2)^n(2p(1-p))$$

Summing over all $n$, we get

\begin{align*}
\sum_{s \in \sspace} \pr{s}
   & = \sum_{n \geq 0} \sum_{\lnth{s} = 2n+2} \pr{s}\\
   & = \sum_{n \geq 0} \paren{p^2 + (1-p)^2}^n(2p(1-p))\\
   & = 2p(1-p)\sum_{n \geq 0} \paren{p^2+(1-p)^2}^n\\
   & = \frac{2p(1-p)}{1- (p^2+(1-p)^2)}\\
   & = \frac{2p(1-p)}{2p - 2p^2} = 1.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\end{problem}
