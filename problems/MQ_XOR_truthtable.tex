\begin{problem}
Show truth tables that verify the equivalence of the following two propositional formulas
\begin{align*}
  (P \QXOR Q),\\
  \QNOT(P \QIFF Q).
\end{align*}

\begin{solution}
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{(}P & \QXOR  & Q\text{)}\\ \hline
\true     &\false      & \true    \\ \hline
\true     &\true       & \false   \\ \hline
\false    &\true       & \true    \\ \hline
\false    &\false      & \false   \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]

\[
\begin{array}{|c|ccc|}
