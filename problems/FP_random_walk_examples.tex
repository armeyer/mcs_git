\begin{problem}
Give simple examples of random walk graphs with the following properties.

\bparts

\ppart A graph with an uncountable number of stationary distributions.

\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
A graph with only two vertices, 1 and 2, and only two edges
$\diredge{1}{1}$ and $\diredge{2}{2}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart A graph with unique stationary distribution that is not strongly connected.

\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
A graph with only two vertices, 1 and 2, and only two edges
$\diredge{1}{2}$ and $\diredge{2}{2}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart A strongly connected graph with an initial distribution that does not
 converge to the stationary distribution.
