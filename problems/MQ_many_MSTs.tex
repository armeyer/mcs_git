\begin{problem}
How many 5-vertex non-isomomorphic trees are there?  Explain.

\examspace[2.0in]

\begin{solution}
\textbf{3}

These are the unique 5-vertex trees with each of two, three and four
leaves:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item the five-vertex star graph, namely, a root with four leaves,
\item a root with three leaves plus an edge attached to a leaf,
\item $L_5$, the line graph with five vertices has two leaves.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
