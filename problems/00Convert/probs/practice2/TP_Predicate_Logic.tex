\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Predicate Logic

Which of the following are \emph{valid}?
\begin{enumerate}

\item
$\exists x \exists y \; P(x, y) \implies \exists y \exists x \; P(x, y)$

\item
$\forall x \exists y \; Q(x, y) \implies \exists y \forall x Q(x, y)$

\item
$\exists x \forall y \; R(x, y)
    \implies \forall y \exists x \; R(x, y)$

\item
$\neg (\exists x \; S(x)) \iff \forall x \; \neg(S(x))$

\end{enumerate}

%% Answer with a sequence of integers separated by some spaces, for
%% example,
%%  
%%  \begin{equation*}
%%  4 3 2 
%%  
%%  \end{equation*}
%%  
%%  Don't use commas or periods.

\begin{solution}
1,
3,
4

1. Quantifiers of the \emph{same} type (existential or universal) can
be reordered without altering the meaning of the statement.

2. For example, let $Q(x, y)$ be $(y > x)$ and suppose the domain is
nonnegative integers.  Then the left side asserts that for every
natural number, there is a larger natural number, which is true.  The
right side asserts that there exists a natural number greater than
every other natural number, which is false.  Therefore, the
implication as a whole is false, and the statement is not valid.

3.  Suppose that the left side is true.  Then there exists an $x_{0}$
such that for all $y$, $R(x_{0}, y)$ is true.  Thus, for all $y$,
there exists an $x$ (namely, $x_{0}$), such that $R(x, y)$ is true.
Therefore, the right side is also true, and the statement is valid.

4. If it's not true that there is an element in the domain with
property $S$, then \emph{every} element in the domain must \emph{not}
have property $S$.  Conversely, if \emph{every} element in the domain
does \emph{not} have property~$S$, it can't be true that some element in
the domain has property $S$.
