\begin{problem} 

\mbox{}

\hint There are easier ways to find these numbers than listing all
the relations and checking which properties each one has.

\bparts
\ppart
How many binary relations are there on the set $A = \set{a, b}$? 

\vspace{1in}

\begin{solution}
TBA
\end{solution}

\ppart
How many are there that are transitive?

\vspace{3in}

\begin{solution}
TBA
\end{solution}

\ppart
How many are there that are both transitive and reflexive? 

\vspace{3in}

\begin{solution}
TBA
\end{solution}
