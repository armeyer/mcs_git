\begin{problem}
  We have two coins: one is a fair coin, but the other produces heads with
  probability $3/4$.  One of the two coins is picked, and this coin is
  tossed $n$ times.  Use the Chernoff Bound to determine the smallest $n$
  which allows determination of which coin was picked with 95\%
  confidence.

\begin{solution}
To guess which coin was picked, set a threshold $t$ between $1/2$ and
$3/4$.\footnote{This is same same approach as in
  Problem~\bref{PS_discriminate_biased_coins_chebyshev}, but here we
  use the Chernoff Bound to try to get a smaller bound on $n$.}  If
the proportion of heads is less than the threshold, guess that the
fair coin had been picked; otherwise, guess the biased coin.  Let the
random variable $F$ be the number of heads that would appear in the
first $n$ flips of the fair coin, and let $B$ denote the number of
heads that would appear in the first $n$ flips of the biased coin.  We
must flip the coin sufficiently many times to ensure that
\begin{equation}\label{confreqFcher}
\Prob{\frac{F}{n} \geq t} \leq 0.05
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{confreqBcher}
\Prob{\frac{B}{n} \leq t} \leq 0.05
\end{equation}
A straightforward threshold is the midpoint between $1/2$ and $3/4$,
namely, $t=5/8$.

Now, $F$ has an $(n,1/2)$-binomial distribution, so its expectation
is $n/2$.  Using Chernoff's Bound $F$, we have
\begin{align*}
\Prob{\frac{F}{n} \geq \frac{5}{8}} 
& = \Prob{F \geq \frac{5}{4} \cdot \expect{F}}\\
& \leq e^{-\beta(5/4)\cdot (n/2)}\\
& \leq (0.986)^n
\end{align*}

The variable $B$, on the other hand, has an $(n,3/4)$-binomial
distribution, so $C \eqdef n - B$ has an $(n,1/4)$-binomial
distribution, and $B \leq k$ iff $C \geq n - k$ and $\expect{C} = n/4$.
Using Chernoff's Bound for $C$, we have
\begin{align*}
\Prob{\frac{B}{n} \leq \frac{5}{8}}
& = \Prob{B \leq \frac{5}{8}n}\\
& = \Prob{C \geq \frac{3}{8}n}\\
& = \Prob{C \geq \frac{3}{2}\expect{C}}\\
& \leq e^{-\beta(3/2)\cdot (n/4)}\\
& \leq (0.974)^n.
\end{align*}

So, for the required confidence level, we require that
\[
(0.986)^n \leq 0.05,
\]
namely, $n \geq 220$, which is a modest improvement over the estimate
of $279$ flips obtained using the Chebyshev Bound in
Problem~\bref{PS_discriminate_biased_coins_chebyshev} but still much
larger than the 40 flips required according to an exact calculation of
the binomial distributiuon.
\end{solution}
