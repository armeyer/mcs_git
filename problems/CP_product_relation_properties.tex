\begin{problem}
  Let $R_1$, $R_2$ be binary relations on the same set, $A$.  A relational
  property is preserved under product, if $R_1 \times R_2$ has the
  property whenever both $R_1$ and $R_2$ have the property.

\bparts

\ppart Verify that each of the following properties are preserved under
product.
\begin{enumerate}

\item reflexivity,

\item asymmetry,

\item transitivity.             %

\end{enumerate}

\ppart
Verify that if \emph{either} of $R_1$ or $R_2$ is irreflexive, then so is $R_1 \cross R_2$.
