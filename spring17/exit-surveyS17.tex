\paper{exit}{}{End-of-term Survey}

\documentclass[handout]{mcs}

This is an optional, anonymous survey; you need not identify your name
or your team, though it helps if you do provide this information.  You
are free to skip any of the questions.

The team coaches have been instructed to turn the surveys in to the
Instructor without looking them over.  The Instructor will also not at
look them until after final grades have been officially submitted.

For questions about how well things worked, please respond for
yourself \textbf{personally}, not how you think they worked for
others.

Finally, this survey is not meant to replace the online
\href{http://web.mit.edu/subjectevaluation}{MIT end-of-term subject
  evaluation form} which we hope you will also complete.
