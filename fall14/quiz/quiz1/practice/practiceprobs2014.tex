\begin{problem}{20}
6 people are sitting in a circle. Each person has a number.
They do a ritual during each round that makes their numbers update.
Each person, to get his number for round $n+1$, takes his number from round $n$, then adds his right neighbor's number from round $n$ to it, and then subtracts his left neighbor's number from round $n$ from it. 

For example if on the current round there is a person $A$ whose number is 5, and $A$'s right neighbor's number is 4, and $A$'s left neighbor's number is 6, then in the following round, $A$'s number will be $5 + 4 - 6  = 3$.

Initially the people are given the numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6$ (in clockwise order, and the person with $6$ is sitting next to the person with $1$).

Thus, after 1 round, their numbers will be $5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 10$.

Prove that there will never be a round when all their numbers are equal.

BIG HINT: Consider what happens to the sum of the numbers.

\solution{
\begin{lemma}
After every round, each number is an integer,
and the sum of the numbers is 21.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The inductive hypothesis $P(n)$ states that after round $n$, the
sum of the numbers is 21 and all numbers are integers.

The base case $P(0)$ follows from summing up the values of
the initial settings of the numbers and noting that all initial values are
integers.

Assuming that $P(n)$ holds, we show that $P(n+1)$ holds.  
Let the values of the numbers at round $n$ be $a_1,\ldots,a_6$.
For each $i$, the new value of the $i^{th}$ person is $a_i +a_{i+1 \rem 6} - a_{i-1 \rem 6}$.
Since the inductive hypothesis tells us that
$a_i,a_{i+1 \rem 6}$ and $a_{i-1 \rem 6}$ are all integers, the new value
of the $i^{th}$ person is also an integer.
The sum at round $n+1$ is $$\sum_{1 \leq i \leq 6} a_i +a_{i+1 \rem 6} - a_{i-1 \rem 6}
= \sum_{1 \leq i \leq 6} a_i + a_i - a_i  = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq 6} a_i =21.$$
The second equality is by reordering the summation, and the third equality
is from the inductive hypothesis.
And so $P(n+1)$ holds by the principle of induction.
\end{proof}

Assume for the purposes of contradiction that there is a round
in which all numbers
are equal to the value $v$.  By the lemma, $v=21/6$ and $v$ is
an integer, which is impossible since 6 does not divide $21$.
Thus, there cannot be a round in which all numbers are equal.

\begin{problem}{15}
We define the sequence of numbers
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_n = \begin{cases}
  1                                    &  \text{if $0 \leq n \leq 3$,}\\
  a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}+ a_{n-4} &  \text{if $n \geq 4$.}
 \end{cases}
\end{eqnarray*}

Prove that $a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ for all $n\geq 0$. 

\solution[\newpage]{
Proof by strong induction. Let $P(n)$ be the 
predicate that $a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$.

Base case: For $0\leq n\leq 3$, $a_n=1$ and is therefore 
$\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$.

Inductive step: For $n \geq 4$, assume $P(k)$ for $0\leq k\leq n$ 
in order to prove $P(n+1)$.

In particular, since each of $a_{n-4}$, $a_{n-3}$, $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ 
is $\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, their sum must be $\equiv 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$.
Therefore, $a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ and $P(n+1)$ holds.}

\begin{problem}{10} 
Find the multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 72 in the range 
$\{0,1,\ldots,71\}$.

\solution[\newpage]{Since 17 and $72=2^3 3^2$ are relatively prime,
an inverse exists and can be found by either Euler's theorem or the
Pulverizer.

{\bf Solution 1: Euler's Theorem}

\begin{align*}
\phi(72) & = \phi(2^3 \cdot 3^2) &\\
          & = \phi(2^3) \cdot \phi(3^2) 
                  & \text{(since $2^3$ and $3^2$ are rel. prime)}\\
          & = (2^3 - 2^2)(3^2 - 3^1)
                  & \text{(since $2$ and $3$ are prime)}\\
          & = 4 \cdot 6 = 24 &
\end{align*}

Therefore, $17^{\phi(72)-1}=17^{23}$ is {\it an} inverse of 17.  To find
{\it the} inverse in the range $\{0,1,\ldots,71\}$ we take the remainder
using the method of repeated squaring:

\begin{align*}
17   & =       17 &\\
17^2 & =       289 &\\
     & \equiv  1 & \text{(since $289=4 \cdot 72 + 1$)}\\
17^4 & \equiv 1^2 = 1 &\\
17^8 & \equiv 1 &\\
& \ldots etc.&
\end{align*}

Therefore the inverse of 17 in the range $\{0,1,\ldots,71\}$ is given by,
\begin{align*}
17^{23} & = 17^{16} 17^{4} 17^{2} 17^{1} \\ 
        & \equiv 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 17 \\
        & = 17
\end{align*}

{\bf Solution 2: The Pulverizer}
\[
\begin{array}{ccccrcl}
x & \quad & y & \quad & \rem{x}{y} & = & x - q \cdot y \\ \hline
72 && 17 && 4   & = &   72 - 4 \cdot 17 \\
17 && 4  && 1   & = &   17 - 4 \cdot 4 \\
&&&&            & = &   17 - 4 \cdot (72 - 4 \cdot 17) \\
&&&&            & = &   17 \cdot 17 - 4 \cdot 72 \\
4 && 1 && 0
\end{array}
\]

Since $17^2 - 4 \cdot 72 = 1$, $17^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{72}$ and so 17
is self inverse.

% comments: graph induction, outerplanar graphs
%
\instatements{\newpage}
\begin{problem}{20} An outerplanar graph is an undirected graph for 
which the vertices \emph{can be} placed on a circle in such a way 
that no edges (drawn as straight lines) cross each other.  For example, 
the complete graph on 4 vertices, $K_4$, is not outerplanar but any 
proper subgraph of $K_4$ with strictly fewer edges is outerplanar. Some
examples are provided below:

\vspace{18pt}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3in]{outerplanar-graphs}}
\vspace{18pt}

Prove that any outerplanar graph is 3-colorable.  A fact you may use 
without proof is that any outerplanar graph has a vertex of degree at 
most 2.

\solution[\newpage]{
Proof by induction on the number of nodes $n$ with the induction 
hypothesis $P(n) =$ ``every outerplanar graph with $n$ vertices is
3-colorable.''

Base case: For $n=1$ the single node graph with no edges is 
trivially outerplanar and 3-colorable.

Inductive step: Assume $P(n)$ holds and let $G_{n+1}$ be an
outerplanar graph with $n+1$ vertices.  There must exist a vertex 
$v$ in $G_{n+1}$ with degree at most 2.  Removing $v$ and all its
incident edges leaves a subgraph $G_n$ with $n$ vertices.

Since $G_{n+1}$ could be drawn with its vertices on a circle and
its edges drawn as straight lines without intersections,
any subgraph can also be drawn in such a way and so $G_n$ is also
an outerplanar graph.  $P(n)$ implies $G_n$ is 3-colorable.  
Therefore we can color all the vertices in $G_{n+1}$ other than $v$
using only 3 colors and since $\deg(v) \leq 2$ we may color it a 
color different than the vertices adjacent to it using only 3 
colors.  Therefore, $G_{n+1}$ is 3-colorable and $P(n+1)$ holds.

    In this problem, we say that an \emph{$M \times N$ grid network} is a
    routing network consisting of an undirected grid of $M$ rows and $N$
    columns, with $M$ inputs on the left and $M$ outputs on the right, as
    depicted in Figure~\ref{3x3grid}. (Note: this is not the same as the ``2-D
    array'' in the notes, which has outputs on the bottom.)

\newpage
\ppart{6} For the $M \times N$ grid network with $M$ inputs on the left
    and $M$ outputs on the right, prove carefully that the congestion is always
    strictly greater than $1$, so long as $M > 1$.

    \solution[\vspace{6in}]{
        Let $(x,y)$ denote coordinates on the grid, for which $(1,1)$ is the
        upper-left corner and $(M,N)$ is the lower-right corner.

        Consider a congestion $1$ routing on this grid. We show, by strong
        induction on $x$, that for all $1 \leq x \leq N$ and $1 \leq y \leq M$,
        the $x$th step of route $y$ is to move to vertex $(x,y)$. The base case
        of $x=1$ is clear: the switch $(1,y)$ is the only switch connected to 
        $\mathsf{in}_y$, and so the first move is forced. 
        Now in the inductive step, suppose that for all $1 \leq y \leq M$ and
        all $i < x$, the $i$th step of route $y$ was to visit vertex $(i,y)$.
        Then at step $x$, route $y$ can not move up, down, or left on the grid,
        as the vertex there (if any) has already been visited, and congestion
        is constrained to be $1$. So the route must move right to $(x,y)$. This
        completes the induction.

        So any congestion $1$ routing must have each route move right along the
        grid rows until it reaches an output. Then the route starting at
        $\mathsf{in}_i$ can only reach $\mathsf{out}_i$, and for $M > 1$, not
        every routing permutation is possible with congestion $1$.
    }

\newpage
\ppart{6} For the $M \times N$ grid, as in part (b), argue that for any
    $M > 1$, it is possible to choose $N$ large enough so that the grid
    has congestion $2$. (A fully-fledged proof is not required, but give
    justification.)

    \emph{Hint: imagine routes traveling along rows and swapping in
    various places.}

    \solution[\newpage]{
        As in the hint, we imagine routes that travel along rows except
        when participating in a swap move as depicted in
        Figure~\ref{swapmove}.

        \begin{figure}[h]
            \begin{center}\includegraphics[width=3cm]{swapmove.pdf}\end{center}
            \caption{A swap move with congestion $2$.}
            \label{swapmove}
        \end{figure}

        Any routing of this form has congestion $2$, so it suffices to
        show that we can find such a routing for any given routing
        problem. There are many ways to do this, and some might recognize
        this as the general mathematical fact that sequences of swaps of
        adjacent elements can achieve any permutation. We give a concrete
        approach below.

        We construct the routing from left to right along the grid, adding
        swap moves to move routes between grid rows. As we may assume $N$
        to be as large as necessary, we may apply as many swap moves as
        necessary. Suppose that input $\mathsf{in}_i$ corresponds
        to the bottom output $\mathsf{out}_M$; then we first swap row $i$
        with row $i+1$, then $i+1$ with $i+2$, and so on until the route
        from $\mathsf{in}_i$ leads to row $M$, where it will cease to
        participate in swaps and ultimately lead to output $\mathsf{out}_M$.
        We then do the same for the route destined for $\mathsf{out}_{M-1}$;
        these swaps will not interfere with the bottom-most route. We repeat,
        moving up the line of outputs, until all routes are on the correct
        output row.

        An example is given in Figure~\ref{swapex}, for the following
        permutation of five elements:
        $$ 1 \mapsto 3, \; 2 \mapsto 5,\; 3 \mapsto 4,\; 4 \mapsto 1,\; 5 \mapsto 2. $$

This almost entirely determines the graph; the only remaining question concerns the edges out of $v$; but $v$ must have an edge to every other vertex $w$ in order for $w$ to be reachable from $v$, i.e.\ in order for the graph to be strongly connected.

$$R = \{(x,y) : x \leq y^2 \mbox{ for } x, y \in \mathbb N \}.$$
Which of the following properties holds for $R$? If it has the property, prove it. If not, provide a counterexample.

\bparts

\ppart{2} Reflexivity.

\solution[\vspace{2in}]{
Yes.  R is reflexive if $\forall x$ $xRx$, that is, 
if $x \leq x^2$.  If $x = 0, 0 \leq 0,$ so reflexivity holds.  
If $x \geq 1$, then it follows that
$x^2 \geq x$, from multiplying both sides of the inequality by $x$, which is positive.  
This covers all $x \in \mathbb N$.
}

\ppart{2} Symmetry.

\solution[\vspace{2in}]{No.  Counterexample: x = 0, y = 1.  $0 \leq 1^2$, but $1 > 0^2$.}

\ppart{2} Transitivity.

\solution[\vspace{2in}]{No.  Counterexample: $x = 10, y = 5, z = 3$.  $10 \leq 5^2$, 
and $5 \leq 3^2$, but $10 \geq 3^2$.}
\newpage
\ppart{2} Antisymmetry.

\solution[\vspace{2in}]{No.  Counterexample: $x = 2, y = 3$.  
$2 \leq 3^2$, and $3 \leq 2^2$, but $3 \neq 2$.}
\ppart{2} The property of being an equivalence relation.

\solution[\vspace{2in}]{No.  An equivalence relation must 
be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  Of those three, the 
relation is only reflexive.}
