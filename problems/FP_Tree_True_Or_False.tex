\begin{problem}

For each one of the statements assert True if it always holds and
False if it is always false. If you make a mistake you lose 4 points,
if the answer is right you get 3 points. The minimum number of points
you can get is 0.

\bparts

\ppart There is a tree whose chromatic number is three.

\ppart For a tree, the maximum number of edges is equal to $\card{V} - 1$.

\ppart If all edges in a weighted graph have distinct weights, then
the graph has a unique MSTs.

\ppart If two edges in a weighted graph have the same weight, then the
graph has at least two MSTs.

\ppart Every Tree has a perfect matching.
