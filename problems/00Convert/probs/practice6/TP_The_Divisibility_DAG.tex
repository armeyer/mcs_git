\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: The Divisibility DAG

\begin{center}

\end{center}

In this~\ref{???} DAG for the divisibility relation on $\{1, \dots,
12\}$, there is an upward path from $a$ to~$b$ iff $a | b$.  If 24 was
added as a vertex, what is the minimum number of edges that must be
added to the DAG to represent divisibility on $\{1, \dots, 12, 24\}$?

\begin{solution}
2

Edges from 8 and 12 to 24 are all that are needed.
\end{solution}
