\begin{problem}
For each of the following pairs of graphs, either define an isomorphism
between them, or prove that there is none.  (We write $ab$ as shorthand
for $\edge{a}{b}$.)

\bparts

\ppart
\begin{align*}
G_1\text{ with }& V_1 = \set{1,2,3,4,5,6},\ E_1= \set{12,23,34,14,15,35,45}\\
G_2\text{ with }& V_2 = \set{1,2,3,4,5,6},\ E_2= \set{12,23,34,45,51,24,25}
\end{align*}

\begin{solution}
Not isomorphic: $G_2$ has a node, 2, of degree 4, but the maximum degree
in $G_1$ is 3.
\end{solution}

\ppart
\begin{align*}
G_3\text{ with } &V_3 = \set{1,2,3,4,5,6},\ E_3= \set{12,23,34,14,45,56,26}\\
G_4\text{ with } &V_4 = \set{a,b,c,d,e,f},\ E_4= \set{ab,bc,cd,de,ae,ef,cf}
\end{align*}

\begin{solution}
Isomorphic (two isomorphisms) with the vertex correspondences: \\
$1f, 2c, 3d, 4e, 5a, 6b$ \\
or $1f, 2e, 3d, 4c, 5b, 6a$

\end{solution}

\ppart
\begin{align*}
G_5\text{ with } & V_5 = \set{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h},\ E_5= \set{ab,bc,cd,ad,ef,fg,gh,he,dh,bf}\\
G_6\text{ with } & V_6 = \set{s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z},\ E_6=\set{st,tu,uv,sv,wx,xy,yz,wz,sw,vz}
\end{align*}

\begin{solution}
Not isomorphic: they have the same number of vertices, edges, and set of
vertex degrees.  But the degree 2 vertices of $G_1$ are all adjacent to
two degree 3 vertices, while the degree 2 vertices of $G_2$ are all
adjacent to one degree 2 vertex and one degree 3 vertex.

\end{solution}
