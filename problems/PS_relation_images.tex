\ppart Give an example of a binary relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$ such
that $RB \neq A$.

\solution{Any relation that has an element in $A$ that does not relate
to any element in $B$, and is therefore not total, will work.

For example, consider the less-than relation $R$ from $A=\{0,1\}$ to 
$B=\{0,1\}$. $RB$ consists of the elements in $A$ that relate to some
element in $B$ and since $1 \in A$ is not less than either 0 or 1, 
$RB = \{0\} \neq A$.} 

\ppart Prove that $R(AR) = RB$ for any binary relation $R$ from $A$ to 
$B$.

\solution{We proceed by showing $x \in R(AR) \iff x \in RB$ using a
chain of if and only if statements.

\begin{align*}
x \in R(AR) & \qiff \exists\, b \in AR \;.\; x\,R\,b\\ 
            & \qiff \exists\, b \in B, a \in A \;.\; a\,R\,b \ \QAND\  x\,R\,b\\
            & \qiff \exists\, b \in B \;.\; x\,R\,b\\
            & \qiff x \in RB\\
\end{align*}

The first and second iff's are simply applications of the definitions 
of the inverse image and image (respectively). The third follows 
directly from the fact that $x \in A$: if $x\,R\,b$ then there must exist 
an $a \in A$, namely $a=x$, such that $a\,R\,b$.}
