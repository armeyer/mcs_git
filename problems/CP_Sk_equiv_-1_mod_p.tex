\begin{problem}
  Let $S_k = 1^k + 2^k + \dots + (p-1)^k$, where $p$ is an odd prime and
  $k$ is a positive multiple of $p - 1$.  Use \idx{Fermat's theorem} to
  prove that $S_k \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$.

\begin{solution}
Fermat's theorem says that $x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$
when $1 \leq x \leq p - 1$.  Since $k$ is a multiple of $p-1$,
raising each side to a suitable power proves that $x^k \equiv 1
\pmod{p}$.  Thus:
%
\begin{align*}
1^k + 2^k + \dots + (p-1)^k
    & \equiv \underbrace{1 + 1 + \dots + 1}_{\text{$p-1$ terms}} \pmod{p} \\
    & \equiv p - 1 \pmod{p} \\
    & \equiv - 1 \pmod{p}
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
