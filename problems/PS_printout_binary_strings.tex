\begin{problem}
Describe a simple procedure which, given a positive integer argument,
$n$, produces a width $n$ array of truth-values whose rows would be
all the possible truth-value assignments for $n$ propositional
variables.  For example, for $n=2$, the array would be:

\[\begin{array}{|cc|}
\hline \true & \true\\
\true & \false\\
\false & \true\\
\false & \false\\
\hline
\end{array}\]

Your description can be in English, or a simple program in some
familiar language such as Python or Java.  \inbook{If you do write a program,
be sure to include some sample output.}

\begin{solution}
A simple recursive approach is to start with an $n=1$ array, namely a
$1 \times 2$ array whose first row has the entry $\true$ and whose
second row has the entry $\false$.  Build the width-$(n+1)$ array for
$n+1$ variables recursively by making two copies of the width-$n$
array for $n$ variables.  Then add a $\false$ entry at the beginning
of each row of the first copy to form an array of width-$(n+1)$, add a
$\true$ entry at the beginning of each row of the second copy to form
a second array of width-$(n+1)$, and finally, place the first
width-$(n+1)$ array on top of the second width-$(n+1)$ array, forming
a width-$(n+1)$ array of twice the height of the width-$n$ array.
This is the answer.

Here's a Python program that carries generates the rows of the array
for $n$ variables in this way:

\begin{verbatim}
def truth_values(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return [[]]
    else:
        def choice(elems):
            return [[False] + e for e in elems] + \
                    [[True] + e for e in elems]
        return choice(truth_values(n - 1))

>>> print truth_values(3)
[[False, False, False], [False, False, True],
    [False, True, False], [False, True, True],
    [True, False, False], [True, False, True],
    [True, True, False], [True, True, True]]
\end{verbatim}

\medskip

An alternative approach makes the observation that the rows of the
array for $n$ variables as constructed above consist of the $n$-bit
binary representations of the successive integers 0 to $2^n -1$, when
we treat $\false$ as a code for 0 and $\true$ as a code for 1.  For
example, if, in the above array for $n=3$, we number successive rows
starting with zero, then row number three has binary representation
\STR{011}, which corresponds to the labelling $(\false\ \true\
\true)$.  So we generate the $k$th row of the array for $n$ variables by
finding the length-$n$ binary representation of $k$ and converting
\STR{0}'s back to $\false$ and \STR{1}'s back to $\true$.

\end{solution}
