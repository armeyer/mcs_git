\begin{problem}
\emph{Token Switching} is a process for updating a set of black and
white tokens.  The process starts with a single black token.  At each
step,


\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item one black token can be replaced with two white tokens, or
\item if the numbers of white and black tokens are not the same, the
  colors of all the tokens can be switched: all the black tokens
  become white, and the white tokens become black.
\end{enumerate}

We can model Token Switching as a state machine whose states are pairs
$(b,w)$ of nonnegative integers, where $b$ equals the number of black
tokens, and $w$ equals the number of white tokens.  So the start state
is $(1,0)$.

\ppart Indicate which of the following states can be reached from the
start state in \emph{exactly} two steps:
\[
(0,0),\ (1,0),\ (0,1),\ (1,1),\ (0,2),\ (2,0),\ (2,1),\ (1,2),\ (0,3),\ (3,0)
\]

\begin{solution}
\[(1,0),\ (2,0)\]

\begin{align*}
(1,0) \to \begin{cases}
          & (0,1) \to (1,0),\\
          & (0,2) \to (2,0).
          \end{cases}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\ppart
Define the predicate $F(b,w)$ by the rule:
\[
F(b,w) \eqdef\ (b - w)\ \text{is not a multiple of 3}.
\]

Prove the following
\begin{claim*}
If $F(b,w)$, then state $(b,w)$ is reachable from the start state.
\end{claim*}

\examspace[3.5in]

\begin{solution}
The proof will be by induction in $n$ using induction hypothesis $P(n)
\eqdef$
\[
 \forall (b, w).\,
 [(b + w = n) \QAND  F(b,w)]
     \QIMPLIES (b,w) \text{ is reachable}.
\]

\begin{proof}

\inductioncase{Base case} ($n \leq 1$):
There are only two states with $n \leq 1$ that satisfy $F$:
\[
(1,0),\ (0,1).
\]
But $(1,0)$ is reachable since it is the start state, and $(0,1)$ is
reachable in one step by switching white and black tokens.

\inductioncase{Inductive step}: Suppose $b + w = n+1$ for some $n \geq
1$ and $F(b,w)$ holds.  We want to show that $(b, w)$ is reachable.

Since $n+1 \geq 2$, either $b \geq 2$ or $w \geq 2$ (the remaining
case $(b,w)=(1,1)$ is ruled out by the condition $F(b,w)$).  Since
$(b,w)$ is reachable iff $(w,b)$ is reachable, we can assume that $w \geq 2$.
This implies that $(b+1,w-2)$ is a state that transitions to
$(b,w)$ in one step.  So we need only show that $(b+1,w-2)$ is
reachable.

Now $F(b+1,w-2)$ holds because 
\[
(b+1)-(w-2) = (b-w) + 3  \equiv b-w \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}.
\]
Also, since
\[
(b+1)+(w-2) = (b+w) - 1 = n,
\]
we conclude by induction hypothesis $P(n)$ that $(b+1,w-2)$ is
reachable.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\ppart Explain why state $(11^{6^{7777}}, 5^{10^{88}})$ is
\emph{not} a reachable state.

\hint Do not assume $F$ is a preserved invariant without proving it.

\begin{solution}
It is easy to see that $\rem{b-w}{3}$ remains unchanged by the the
first transition rule and gets negated by the second rule, which
implies that $F$ is indeed a preserved invariant.  Since $F$ holds for
the start state $(1,0)$, it follows that it holds for all reachable
states.

We claim that $11^{6^{7777}}$ and $5^{10^{88}}$ are both $\equiv 1
\bmod{3}$, so state $(11^{6^{7777}}, 5^{10^{88}})$ does not satisfy
the invariant $F$ and is therefore unreachable.

To prove this claim, note that
\[
11 \equiv 2 \equiv 5 \pmod{3},
\]
so both
$11^{6^{7777}}$ and $5^{10^{88}}$ are congruent to
\[
2^{\text{even number}} \equiv 1 \pmod{3}.
\]
