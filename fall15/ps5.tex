\pinput{PS_Euler_function_multiplicativity}

%%%RSA Cryptosystem%%% 
\pinput{MQ_RSA_reversed} 
%%%%%%%%\pinput{PS_RSA_collision_probability_200.tex} %important but light weight for a pset
%\pinput{FP_RSA_TF.tex} 
%\pinput{MQ_factoring_cracks_RSA.tex} 
%\pinput{PS_RSA_key_implies_factoring.tex} % too many unproven "good facts to know" and covers material beyond what we expect students to learn. 
%\pinput{MQ_RSA_collision_probability_200.tex}
%\pinput{MQ_RSA_collision_probability_300.tex}

%%%DAGs and Scheduling%%%
%the following 4 are listed in the book as practice problems
