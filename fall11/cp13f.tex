Students may finish early.  Here's an extra problem to offer
(part~(a) of~\bref{TP_indicator_independence}):

Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then so are
$A$ and $\setcomp{B}$.
\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
\pr{A \intersect \setcomp{B}}
  &  = \pr{A} - \pr{A \intersect B}
       & \text{(difference rule)}\\
  & =  \pr{A} - \pr{A} \cdot \pr{B}
       & \text{(independence of $A$ and $B$)}\\
  & =  \pr{A} (1 - \pr{B})\\
  & =  \pr{A} \cdot \pr{\setcomp{B}} & \text{(complement rule)}.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
