\begin{problem}
The most straightforward way to compute the $b$th power of a number, $a$,
is to multiply $a$ by itself $b$ times.  This of course requires $b-1$
multiplications.  There is another way to do it using considerably fewer
multiplications.  This algorithm is called \emph{Fast Exponentiation}:

Given inputs $a \in \reals, b \in \naturals$,
initialize registers $x,y,z$ to $a,1,b$ respectively,
and repeat the following sequence of steps until termination:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $z=0$ \textbf{return} $y$ and terminate
\item $r := \text{remainder}(z,2)$
\item $z := \text{quotient}(z,2)$
\item if $r = 1$, then $y := xy$
\item $x := x^2$
\end{itemize}
We claim this algorithm always terminates and leaves $y = a^b$.

\bparts

\ppart  Model this algorithm with a state
machine, carefully defining the states and transitions.

\solution{
\begin{enumerate}
\item The set of states is $\reals \cross \reals \cross \naturals$,
\item The start state is $(a,1,b)$,
\item the transitions are defined by the rule
\begin{equation*}
(x,y,z) \rightarrow
\begin{cases}
(x^2, y, \text{quotient}(z,2)) & \text{if $z$ is positive and even},\\
(x^2, xy, \text{quotient}(z,2)) & \text{if $z$ is positive and odd}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
}

\ppart Let $d \eqdef a^b$.  Verify that the following predicate, $P$, is
a preserved invariant:
\[
P((x,y,z)) \eqdef\ \ [yx^z = d].
\]

\solution{
We show that $P$ is preserved, namely, assuming $P((x,y,z))$, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{yxzd}
yx^z = d
\end{equation}
holds and $(x,y,z) \rightarrow (x_t,y_t,z_t)$ is a transition, then
$P((x_t,y_t,z_t))$, that is,
\[
y_tx_t^{z_t} = d
\]
holds.

We consider two cases:

If $z > 0$ and is even, then we have that $x_t = x^2, y_t = y, z_t =
\quotient(z,2)$.  Therefore,
\begin{align*}
y_tx_t^{z_t} &  = yx^{2 \cdot \quotient(z,2)}\\
           & = yx^{2 \cdot \frac{z}{2}}\\
           & = yx^z\\
          & = d & \mbox{(by~\eqref{yxzd})}
\end{align*}

If $z > 0$ and is odd, then we have that $x_t = x^2, y_t = xy, z_t =
\quotient(z,2)$. Therefore,
\begin{align*}
y_tx_t^{z_t} & = xyx^{2 \cdot \quotient(z,2)}\\
& = yx^{1+2 \cdot \frac{z-1}{2}}\\
& = yx^{1+(z-1)}\\
& = yx^z\\
& = d & \mbox{(by~\eqref{yxzd})}
\end{align*}

So in both cases, $P((x_t,y_t,z_t))$ holds, proving that $P$ is a
preserved invariant.}

\ppart Prove that the algorithm is partially correct: if it halts, it does
so with $y=d$.

\solution{$P$ holds for the start state $(a,1,b)$ since $1\cdot a^b = a^b
  =d$ by definition.  So by the Invariant Theorem, $P$ holds for all
  reachable states.  But a terminal state must have $z = 0$, so if any
  terminal state $(x,y,0)$ is reachable, then $y = yx^0 = d$ as required.}

\ppart Prove that the algorithm terminates.

\solution{Just notice that $z$ is a natural-number-valued variable that
gets smaller at every transition.  So by the Well-Ordering Principle, when
this variable reaches its minimum value, the algorithm terminates.}

\ppart In fact, prove that it requires at most $2 \log_2 b$
multiplications for the Fast Exponentiation algorithm to compute $a^b$ for
$b>1$.

\solution{The value of $z$ is initially $b$ and gets halved at least at
every step.  So it can't be halved more than $\log_2 b$ times before
hitting zero.}
