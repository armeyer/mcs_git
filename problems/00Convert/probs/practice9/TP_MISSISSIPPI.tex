\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: MISSISSIPPI

How many different permutations are there of the sequence of letters
in ``MISSISSIPPI''?

% (You may answer with an expression such as \textbf{(5!^2)/(3!*4!)}.

\begin{solution}
% $11! / (1! * 4! * 4! * 2!)$.

There are 11 letters consisting of 1~M, 4~I's, 4~S's, 2~P's, so the
multinomial coefficient
\begin{equation*}
\binom{11}{1, 4, 4, 2}
\end{equation*}
gives the answer.  It's value is $11! / (1! * 4! * 4! * 2!) = 34650$.
\end{solution}
