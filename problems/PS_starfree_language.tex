\begin{problem}
A \emph{binary word} is a finite sequence of \STR{0}'s and
\STR{1}'s.  For example, $(\STR{1},\STR{1},\STR{0})$ and
$(\STR{1})$ are words of length three and one, respectively.  We
usually omit the parentheses and commas in the descriptions of words,
so the preceding binary words would just be written as $\STR{110}$
and $\STR{1}$.

The basic operation of placing one word immediately after another is
called \term{concatentation}.  For example, the concatentation of
$\STR{110}$ and $\STR{1}$ is $\STR{1101}$, and the
concatentation of $\STR{110}$ with itself is $\STR{110110}$.

We can extend this basic operation on words to an operation on
\emph{sets} of words.  To emphasize the distinction between a word and
a set of words, from now on we'll refer to a set of words as a
\emph{language}.  Now if $R$ and $S$ are languages, then $R \cdot S$
is the language consisting of all the words you can get by
concatenating a word from $R$ with a word from $S$.  That is,
\[
R \cdot S \eqdef \set{rs \suchthat r \in R \QAND s \in S}.
\]
For example,
\[
\set{\STR{0},\STR{00}}\cdot \set{\STR{00},\STR{000}} =
\set{\STR{000},\STR{0000},\STR{00000}}
\]

Another example is $D \cdot D$, abbreviated as $D^2$, where $D \eqdef
\set{\STR{1}, \STR{0}}$ is just the two binary digits.
\[
D^2 = \set{\STR{00},\STR{01},\STR{10},\STR{11}}.
\]
In other words, $D^2$ is the language consisting of all the length-two
words.  More generally, $D^n$ will be the language of all the words of
length $n$.

If $S$ is a language, the language you can get by concatenating any
number of copies of words in $S$ is called $S^*$---pronounced ``$S$
star.''  (By convention, the empty word $\emptystring$ always
included in $S^*$.)  For example, $\set{\STR{0},\STR{11}}^*$ is the
language consisting of all the words you can make by stringing
together $\STR{0}$'s and $\STR{11}$'s.  This language could also be
described as consisting of the words whose blocks of $\STR{1}$'s are
always of even length.  Another example is $(D^2)^*$, which consists
of all the even length words.  Finally, the language $B$ of
\emph{all} binary words is just $D^*$.

A language is called \emph{Concatenation-Definable} (\CDlang) if it
can be constructed by starting with finite languages and then applying
the operations of concatenation, union, and complement (relative to
$B$) to these languages a finite number of times.
\iffalse
\footnote{ We can
  assign to each c-d language a \emph{count} which bounds the number
  of the allowed operations (Union, Concatenation, and Complement) it
  takes to make it.

Since finite languages are given to be C-D, they are the 0-count
languages.  For example,
\begin{itemize}
\item  $\set{00, 111}$,
\item  the words of length $\leq 10^{10}$, and
\item  the empty language $\emptyset$
\end{itemize}
are all 0-count.

We get a 1-count language by applying one of the operations to a
0-count language.  So applying the complement operation to each of the
above 0-count languages gives the following 1-count languages:
\begin{itemize}
\item  $\overline{\set{00, 111}}$, the language of all binary words
       except $\STR{00}$ and $\STR{111}$,
\item  the words of length $> 10^{10}$, and
\item  the language $B$ of all words.
\end{itemize}
These languages are all infinite, so none of them are 0-count.

Notice that you don't get anything new by using the Union operation to
combine two 0-count languages, since the union of finite sets is
finite.  Likewise, you don't get anything new by concatenating two
0-count languages because the Concatenation of two finite languages is
finite---if $R$ and $S$ are finite languages respectively containing
$n$ and $m$ words, then $R \cdot S$ contains at most $mn$ words.
(Exercise, give an example where $R \cdot S$ contains \emph{fewer}
than $mn$ words.)

So the 1-count languages that are not 0-count are precisely those that
come from complementing a finite language.  That is, they are the
languages that include all but a finite number of words.

We can apply Concatenation to a 0-count and a 1-count language to get a
2-count language.  For example,
\[
\set{\STR{00}, \STR{111}} \cdot B
\]
is a 2-count language consisting of all the words that start with
either 00 or 111.  Notice that this language is not 0-count or
1-count, since both it and its complement are infinite.

Doing a concatenation of the 1-count language $B$ with this 2-count
language, gives a $1+1+2 =4$-count language
\[
B \cdot \set{00,111}\cdot B
\]
which consists of all the words that have either two consecutive
\STR{0}'s or three consecutive \STR{1}'s.  We don't know at this point
whether this language is also 3-count, or even 2-count, because we
haven't ruled out the possibility that it could be built using fewer
than 4 operations (though we don't think it can).

Now doing a complement of this 4-count language give a 5-count
language consisting of all the words in which

\begin{itemize}

\item every occurrence of \STR{0} is followed by a \STR{1},
  except for a possible \STR{0} at the end of the word, and also

\item every occurrence of\STR{11} is followed by a \STR{0}, except for
  a possible \STR{11} at the end of the word.

\end{itemize}

The c-d languages are precisely the languages that are $n$-count for
some nonnegative integer $n$.}
\fi

Note that the $^*$-operation is \emph{not} allowed.  For this reason,
the c-d languages are also called the ``star-free languages,''
\cite{Meyer69}.

Lots of interesting languages turn out to be concatenation-definable,
but some very simple languages are not.  This problem ends with the
conclusion that the language $\set{\STR{00}}^*$ of even length words
whose bits are all \STR{0}'s is not a C-D language.

\begin{problemparts}
\ppart Show that the set $B$ of all binary words is C-D.
\hint The empty set is finite.

\begin{solution}
The empty set $\emptyset$ is fiite and therefore C-D by base case
definition.  Therefore, $\bar{\emptyset}$ which equals $B$ is C-d
using the set-complement constructor
\end{solution}

\eparts

\medskip

Now a more interesting example of a C-D set is the language of all
binary words that include three consecutive \STR{1}'s:
\[
B\STR{111}B.
\]
Notice that the proper expression here is ``$B \cdot
\set{\STR{111}} \cdot B$.''  But it causes no confusion and helps
readability to omit the dots in concatenations and the curly braces
for sets with only one element.

\bparts 
\ppart Show that the language consisting of the binary words that
start with \STR{0} and end with \STR{1} is C-D.

\begin{solution}
$0B1$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Show that $\STR{0}^*$ is C-D.

\begin{solution}
This is simply the binary words that do not contain a \STR{1}
\[
\STR{0}^* = \bar{B \STR{1} B}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{RiScd}  Show that if $R$ and $S$ are C-D, then so is $R \intersect S$.

\begin{solution}
By DeMorgan's Law for sets
\[
R \intersect S = \bar{\bar{R} \union \bar{S}}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Show that $\set{\STR{01}}^*$ is C-D.

\begin{solution}
This language consists of the words that do not include \STR{00} or
\STR{11}, and start with \STR{0}, and end with \STR{1}, along with the
empty word $\emptystring$ which is the complement of the set of
words of length one or more:
\begin{align*}
\set{\emptystring} & = \overline{\set{\STR{0},\STR{1}}B},\\
\set{\STR{01}}^*   & = (\bar{B\set{\STR{00},\STR{11}}B} \intersect 0B1) \union \set{\emptystring}.
\end{align*}

Another way to say this is that $\set{\STR{01}}^*$ consists of the
words that do \emph{not} start wrong, end wrong, or contain a wrong
substring:
\[
\set{\STR{01}}^* = \bar{1B \union B0 \union B\set{\STR{00},\STR{11}}B }
\]
\end{solution}

\eparts

\medskip

Let's say a language $S$ is \STR{0}-\emph{finite} when it includes
only a finite number of words whose bits are all \STR{0}'s, that is,
when $S \intersect \STR{0}^*$ is a finite set of words.  A langauge
$S$ is \STR{0}-\emph{boring}---boring, for short---when either $S$ or
$\bar{S}$ is \STR{0}-finite.

\bparts

\ppart Explain why $\set{\STR{00}}^*$ is not boring.

\begin{solution}
The language $\set{\STR{00}}^*$ is an infinite set consisting of all
even length all-\STR{0} words, and so is not \STR{0}-finite.  Its
complement contains the infinite set of all the odd length all-\STR{0}
words, and so is also not \STR{0}-finite.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{uc0simp} Verify that if $R$ and $S$ are boring, then so
is $R \union S$.

\begin{solution}
There are two cases:

\inductioncase{Case 1}: (Both $R$ and $S$ are \STR{0}-finite.)

Since the union of finite sets is finite, $R \union S$ must also be
\STR{0}-finite, so $R \union S$ is boring.

\inductioncase{Case 2}: (At least one $\bar{R}$ and $\bar{S}$ is
\STR{0}-finite.)

We can safely assume that it is $\bar{R}$ that is \STR{0}-finite.
But $\bar{R \union S} \subseteq \bar{R}$, so $\bar{R \union S}$ must
also be \STR{0}-finite.  Therefore $R \union S$ is boring in this
case as well.
\end{solution}

\ppart Verify that if $R$ and $S$ are boring, then so is $R \cdot S$.

\hint By cases: whether $R$ and $S$ are both \STR{0}-finite,
whether $R$ or $S$ contains no all-\STR{0} words at all (including
the empty word $\emptystring$), and whether neither of these cases
hold.

\begin{solution}
There are four cases.

\inductioncase{Case 1}: (Both $R$ and $S$ are \STR{0}-finite.)

Since the concatenation of two finite sets of words is finite, $R
\cdot S$ is \STR{0}-finite and therefore is boring in this case.

\inductioncase{Case 2}: (Either $R$ or $S$ contains no all-\STR{0} words.)

In this case, $R \cdot S$ won't contain any all-\STR{0} words
either, which means it is \STR{0}-finite and boring.

\inductioncase{Case 3}: ($\bar{R}$ is \STR{0}-finite.)

Let's say the length of the longest all-\STR{0} word in $\bar{R}$
is $n$.  Then $R$ must contain every all-\STR{0} word longer than
$n$.  We can assume that $S$ includes some all-\STR{0} word, say of
length $k$, since otherwise Case 2.\ would apply.  But this means that
that $R \cdot S$ contains every all-\STR{0} word longer than $n+k$.
So every all-\STR{0} word in $\bar{R \cdot S}$ has length at most
$n+k$, and there are only a finite number of such words.  Hence $R
\cdot S$ is \STR{0}-finite and therefore is boring.

\inductioncase{Case 4}: ($\bar{S}$ is \STR{0}-finite.)  Same proof as
for Case 3.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{cdimp0s} Explain why all C-D languages are boring.

\begin{solution}
The starting C-D languages are the finite sets, and these are boring
by definition.  Also, $S$ is boring iff $\bar{S}$ is boring, because
$S = \bar{\bar{S}}$.  By part~\eqref{uc0simp}, we conclude that all
the operations for constructing C-D languages preserve boredome.
Hence all C-D languages are boring.
\end{solution}

So we have proved that the set $(\STR{00})^*$ of even length
all-\STR{0} words is not a C-D language.

Let $w$ be a binary word and $n$ a nonnegative integer.  A set $S$ of
words \emph{$n$-repeats $w$}, a word with $n$ consecutive occurrences
of $w$ is in $S$ iff that word with an extra occurrence of $w$ is also
in $S$.  That is,
\[
xw^ny \in S \QIFF xw^nwy \in S.
\]
We say a set of words is \emph{$n$-repeating} if it $n$-repeats every
word $w$.  For example, $\STR{0}^*$ is 1-repeating and $B$ is actually 0-repeating.

\begin{problemparts}
\ppart Verify that $\set{\STR{01}}^*$ is 2-repeating.

\begin{solution}
TBA
\end{solution}

\ppart Explain why $\set{\STR{00}}^*$ is not $n$-repeating for any $n$.

\begin{solution}
$\set{\STR{00}}^*$ does not $n$-repeat \STR{0} for any $n$,
  because \STR{0}^n is in $\set{\STR{00}}^*$ but $\STR{0}^n
  \STR{0}$ is not.
\end{solution}
