\ppart First, we flip a fair coin. If heads comes up, then we roll one
die and take the result.  If tails comes up, then we roll two dice and
take the sum of the two results.  Circle the probability that this
process yields a 2.

1/36\qquad 7/72\qquad 1/6\qquad 7/36\qquad Other

\ppart Tom and Jerry are two applicants for the same summer internship
at Google.  Since Tom and Jerry are equally qualified, Marla, who has
to hire one of them, decides to toss a coin exactly three times.  Tom
will get the internship if at least two heads are obtained, otherwise
Jerry will.  Marla's coin turns out to have a bias in favor of Tails.
Explain who has a higher probability of being accepted to the Google
Internship.

\exambox{6.0in}{2.0in}{0in}

\begin{solution}
Jerry has the higher probability.  Since Tails are more likely than
Heads, two Tails and a Head is more likely than two Heads and a Tail,
and three Tails are more likely than three Heads.  Specifically,
$\prob{2 \text{ Tails}}= 3pq^2 > 3p^2q = \prob{2 \text{ Heads}}$ iff
$q>p$, where $p$ is the probability of Head and $q$ the probability of
a Tail.  Likewise $\prob{3 \text{ Tails}}> \prob{3 \text{ Heads}}$ iff
$q>p$.
