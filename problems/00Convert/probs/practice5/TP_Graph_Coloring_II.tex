\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Graph Coloring II

What is the chromatic number of a tree?

\begin{solution}

A tree has no cycles. Therefore it is bipartite (has no cycles of odd
length).  This means 2 colors are \emph{sufficient}. Moreover, if the tree
has at least one edge, 2 colors are also \emph{necessary}.  So the
chromatic number is~2.

Note that the question assumes we are in this non-trivial case, where
the tree contains at least one edge. In the trivial case where the
tree contains no edges, we know it has only one vertex (since it must
be connected), and its chromatic number is~1.
\end{solution}
