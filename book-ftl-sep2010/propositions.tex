\chapter{Propositions}\label{prop_chap}

\begin{definition*}
A \term{proposition} is a statement that is either true or false.
\end{definition*}

For example, both of the following statements are propositions.  The
first is true and the second is false.
\begin{proposition}
2 + 3 = 5.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
1 + 1 = 3.
\end{proposition}
Being true or false doesn't sound like much of a limitation, but it
does exclude statements such as, ``Wherefore art thou Romeo?'' and
``Give me an \emph{A}!''.

Unfortunately, it is not always easy to decide if a proposition is true
or false, or even what the proposition means.  In part, this is
because the English language is riddled with ambiguities.  For
example, consider the following statements:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``You may have cake, or you may have ice cream.''
\item ``If pigs can fly, then you can understand the Chebyshev bound.''
\item ``If you can solve any problem we come up with, then you get an
  \emph{A} for the course.''
\item ``Every American has a dream.''
\end{enumerate}
%
What \emph{precisely} do these sentences mean?  Can you have both cake
and ice cream or must you choose just one dessert?  If the second
sentence is true, then is the Chebyshev bound incomprehensible?  If
you can solve some problems we come up with but not all, then do you
get an \emph{A} for the course?  And can you still get an \emph{A}
even if you can't solve any of the problems?  Does the last sentence
imply that all Americans have the same dream or might some of them
have different dreams?

Some uncertainty is tolerable in normal conversation.  But when we need to
formulate ideas precisely---as in mathematics and programming---the
ambiguities inherent in everyday language can be a real problem.  We can't
hope to make an exact argument if we're not sure exactly what the
statements mean.  So before we start into mathematics, we need to
investigate the problem of how to talk about mathematics.

To get around the ambiguity of English, mathematicians have devised a
special mini-language for talking about logical relationships.  This
language mostly uses ordinary English words and phrases such as ``or'',
``implies'', and ``for all''.  But mathematicians endow these words with
definitions more precise than those found in an ordinary dictionary.
Without knowing these definitions, you might sometimes get the gist of
statements in this language, but you would regularly get misled about what
they really meant.

Surprisingly, in the midst of learning the language of mathematics, we'll
come across the most important open problem in computer science---a
problem whose solution could change the world.

\section{Compound Propositions}

In English, we can modify, combine, and relate propositions with words
such as ``not'', ``and'', ``or'', ``implies'', and ``if-then''.
For example, we can combine three propositions into one like this:
%
\begin{center}
\textbf{If} all humans are mortal \textbf{and} all Greeks are human,
\textbf{then} all Greeks are mortal.
\end{center}

For the next while, we won't be much concerned with the internals of
propositions---whether they involve mathematics or Greek mortality---but
rather with how propositions are combined and related.  So we'll
frequently use variables such as $P$ and $Q$ in place of specific
propositions such as ``All humans are mortal'' and ``$2 + 3 = 5$''.  The
understanding is that these variables, like propositions, can take on only
the values \true ~(true) and \false ~(false).  Such true/false variables are
sometimes called \term{Boolean variables} after their inventor,
George---you guessed it---Boole. 

\subsection{\QNOT, \QAND, and \QOR}

We can precisely define these special words using \term{truth tables}.
For example, if $P$ denotes an arbitrary proposition, then the
truth of the proposition ``$\QNOT(P)$'' is defined by the following
truth table:
%
\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
P & \QNOT(P) \\ \hline
\true & \false \\
\false & \true \\
\end{array}
\]
%
The first row of the table indicates that when proposition $P$ is true,
the proposition ``$\QNOT(P)$'' is false.  The second line indicates that
when $P$ is false, ``$\QNOT(P)$'' is true.  This is probably what you would
expect.

In general, a truth table indicates the true/false value of a proposition
for each possible setting of the variables.  For example, the truth table
for the proposition ``$P \QAND Q$'' has four lines, since the two
variables can be set in four different ways:
%
\[
\begin{array}{cc|c}
P & Q & P \QAND Q \\ \hline
\true & \true & \true \\
\true & \false & \false \\
\false & \true & \false \\
\false & \false & \false
\end{array}
\]
%
According to this table, the proposition ``$P \QAND Q$'' is true only when
$P$ and $Q$ are both true.  This is probably the way you think about the
word ``and.''

There is a subtlety in the truth table for ``$P \QOR Q$'':
%
\[
\begin{array}{cc|c}
P & Q & P \QOR Q \\ \hline
\true & \true & \true \\
\true & \false & \true \\
\false & \true & \true \\
\false & \false & \false
\end{array}
\]
%
The third row of this table says that ``$P \QOR Q$'' is true even if
\textit{both} $P$ and $Q$ are true.  This isn't always the intended
meaning of ``or'' in everyday speech, but this is the standard definition
in mathematical writing.  So if a mathematician says, ``You may have cake,
or you may have ice cream,'' he means that you \textit{could} have both.

If you want to exclude the possibility of both having and eating, you should use
``exclusive-or'' ($\QXOR$):
%
\[\begin{array}{cc|c}
P & Q & P \QXOR Q \\ \hline
\true & \true & \false \\
\true & \false & \true \\
\false & \true & \true \\
\false & \false & \false
\end{array}
\]
%

\subsection{\QIMPLIES}

The least intuitive connecting word is ``implies.''  Here is its truth
table, with the lines labeled so we can refer to them later.
%
\[
\begin{array}{cc|cr}
    P  &   Q    & \parbox[b]{13ex}{$P \QIMP Q$} \\ \hline
\true  & \true  & \true & \text{(tt)}\\
\true  & \false & \false  & \text{(tf)}\\
\false & \true  & \true  & \text{(ft)}\\
\false & \false & \true  & \text{(ff)}
\end{array}
\]
Let's experiment with this definition.  For example, is the following
proposition true or false?
\begin{center}
``If the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then $x^2 \geq 0$ for every real
number $x$.''
\end{center}
The Riemann Hypothesis is a famous unresolved conjecture in
mathematics ---no one knows if it is true or false.  But that
doesn't prevent you from answering the question!  This proposition has
the form $P \QIMPLIES Q$ where the \emph{hypothesis},~$P$, is ``the
Riemann Hypothesis is true'' and the \emph{conclusion},~$Q$, is ``$x^2
\geq 0$ for every real number $x$''.  Since the conclusion is
definitely true, we're on either line (tt) or line (ft) of the truth
table.  Either way, the proposition as a while is \emph{true}!

One of our original examples demonstrates an even stranger side of
implications.
\begin{center}
``If pigs can fly, then you can understand the Chebyshev bound.''
\end{center}
Don't take this as an insult; we just need to figure out whether this
proposition is true or false.  Curiously, the answer has
\emph{nothing} to do with whether or not you can understand the
Chebyshev bound.  Pigs cannot fly, so we're on either line (ft) or
line (ff) of the truth table.  In both cases, the proposition is
\textit{true}!

In contrast, here's an example of a false implication:
%
\begin{center}
``If the moon shines white, then the moon is made of white cheddar.''
\end{center}
%
Yes, the moon shines white.  But, no, the moon is not made of white
cheddar cheese.  So we're on line (tf) of the truth table, and the
proposition is false.

The truth table for implications can be summarized in words as
follows:
%
\begin{center}
\textit{An implication is true exactly when the if-part is false or the
then-part is true.}
\end{center}
%
This sentence is worth remembering; a large fraction of all
mathematical statements are of the if-then form!

\subsection{IFF}

Mathematicians commonly join propositions in one additional way that
doesn't arise in ordinary speech.  The proposition ``$P$ if and only
if $Q$'' asserts that $P$ and $Q$ are logically equivalent; that is,
either both are true or both are false.
%
\[
\begin{array}{cc|c}
P & Q & P \QIFF Q \\ \hline
\true & \true & \true \\
\true & \false & \false \\
\false & \true & \false \\
\false & \false & \true
\end{array}
\]

For example, the following if-and-only-if statement is true for every
real number $x$:
%
\begin{center}
$x^2 - 4 \geq 0 \qiff |x| \geq 2$
\end{center}
%
For some values of $x$, \textit{both} inequalities are true.  For
other values of $x$, \textit{neither} inequality is true .  In every
case, however, the proposition as a whole is true.

\subsection{Notation}

Mathematicians have devised symbols to represent words like ``\QAND''
and ``\QNOT''.  The most commonly-used symbols are summarized in the
table below.
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{English} & \textbf{Symbolic Notation} \\[1ex]
$\QNOT(P)$ & $\neg P$ \quad (alternatively, $\bar{P}$) \\
$P \QAND Q$ & $P \land Q$ \\
$P \QOR Q$ & $P \lor Q$ \\
$P \QIMP Q$ & $P \implies Q$ \\
if $P$ then $Q$ & $P \implies Q$ \\
$P \QIFF Q$ & $P \iff Q$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
For example, using this notation, ``If $P \QAND \QNOT(Q)$, then $R$''
would be written:
%
\[
    (P \land \bar{Q}) \implies R
\]
This symbolic language is helpful for writing complicated logical
expressions compactly.  But words such as ``\QOR'' and ``\QIMPLIES''
generally serve just as well as the symbols~$\lor$ and~$\implies$, and
their meaning is easy to remember.  We will use the prior notation for
the most part in this text, but you can feel free to use whichever
convention is easiest for you.

\subsection{Logically Equivalent Implications}\label{sec:logical_equivalence}

Do these two sentences say the same thing?
%
\begin{center}
If I am hungry, then I am grumpy. \\
If I am not grumpy, then I am not hungry.
\end{center}
%
We can settle the issue by recasting both sentences in terms of
propositional logic.
Let $P$ be the proposition ``I am hungry'', and let $Q$ be ``I am
grumpy''.  The first sentence says ``$P \QIMPLIES Q$'' and the second
says ``$\QNOT(Q) \QIMP \QNOT(P)$''.  We can compare these two
statements in a truth table:
%
\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
P & Q &
    P \QIMP Q &
    \QNOT(Q) \QIMP \QNOT(P) \\ \hline
\true & \true & \true & \true \\
\true & \false & \false & \false \\
\false & \true & \true & \true \\
\false & \false & \true & \true
\end{array}
\]
%
Sure enough, the columns of truth values under these two statements are
the same, which precisely means they are equivalent.  In general,
``$\QNOT(Q) \QIMP \QNOT(P)$'' is called the \term{contrapositive} of
the implication ``$P \QIMP Q$.''  And, as we've just shown, the two
are just different ways of saying the same thing.

In contrast, the \term{converse} of ``$P \QIMP Q$'' is the statement
``$Q \QIMP P$''.  In terms of our example, the converse is:
%
\begin{center}
If I am grumpy, then I am hungry.
\end{center}
%
This sounds like a rather different contention, and a truth table
confirms this suspicion:
%
\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
P & Q &
    P \QIMP Q &
    Q \QIMP P \\ \hline
\true & \true & \true & \true \\
\true & \false & \false & \true \\
\false & \true & \true & \false \\
\false & \false & \true & \true
\end{array}
\]
%
Thus, an implication \textit{is} logically equivalent to its
contrapositive but is \textit{not} equivalent to its converse.

One final relationship: an implication and its converse together are
equivalent to an iff statement.  For example,
%
\begin{center}
If I am grumpy, then I am hungry, \QAND \\
if I am hungry, then I am grumpy.
\end{center}
%
are equivalent to the single statement:
%
\begin{center}
I am grumpy $\QIFF$ I am hungry.
\end{center}
%
Once again, we can verify this with a truth table:
%
\[
\begin{array}{c|c|cc|c|c}
P & Q
& (P \QIMP Q) & (Q \QIMP P) 
& (P\QIMP Q) \QAND (Q \QIMP P) & P \QIFF Q \\
\hline
\true  &  \true  &\true  &\true  &\true & \true \\
\true  &  \false &\false &\true  &\false& \false\\
\false &  \true  &\true  &\false &\false& \false\\
\false &  \false &\true  &\true  &\true & \true 
\end{array}
\]

\section{Propositional Logic in Computer Programs}

Propositions and logical connectives arise all the time in computer
programs.  For example, consider the following snippet, which could be
either C, C++, or Java:
%
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{1in} \= \quad\quad \= \quad\quad \= \quad\quad \= \kill
\> \texttt{if ( x > 0 || (x <= 0 \&\& y > 100) )} \\
\> \> \vdots\\
\> \textit{(further instructions)}
\end{tabbing}
%
The symbol \texttt{||} denotes ``\QOR'', and the symbol \texttt{\&\&}
denotes ``\QAND''.  The \textit{further instructions} are carried out
only if the proposition following the word \texttt{if} is true.  On
closer inspection, this big expression is built from two simpler
propositions.  Let $A$ be the proposition that \texttt{x > 0}, and let
$B$ be the proposition that \texttt{y > 100}.  Then we can rewrite the
condition ``$A \QOR (\QNOT(A) \QAND B)$''.
%
A truth table reveals that this complicated expression is logically
equivalent to ``$A \QOR B$''.
\[
\begin{array}{cc|c|c}
A & B &
    A \QOR  (\QNOT(A) \QAND  B) &
    A \QOR  B \\ \hline
\true & \true & \true & \true \\
\true & \false & \true & \true \\
\false & \true & \true & \true \\
\false & \false & \false & \false
\end{array}
\]
%
This means that we can simplify the code snippet without changing the
program's behavior:
%
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{1in} \= \quad\quad \= \quad\quad \= \quad\quad \= \kill
\> \texttt{if ( x > 0 || y > 100 )} \\
\> \> \vdots\\
\> \textit{(further instructions)}
\end{tabbing}

Rewriting a logical expression involving many variables in the
simplest form is both difficult and important.  Simplifying
expressions in software can increase the speed of your program.  Chip
designers face a similar challenge---instead of minimizing
\texttt{\&\&} and \texttt{||} symbols in a program, their job is to
minimize the number of analogous physical devices on a chip.  The
payoff is potentially enormous: a chip with fewer devices is smaller,
consumes less power, has a lower defect rate, and is cheaper to
manufacture.

\section{Predicates and Quantifiers}\label{pred_sec}

\subsection{Propositions with Infinitely Many Cases}

Most of the examples of propositions that we have considered thus far
have been straightforward in the sense that it has been relatively easy to
determine if they are true or false.  At worse, there were only a few
cases to check in a truth table.  Unfortunately, not all propositions
are so easy to check.  That is because some propositions may involve a
large or infinite number of possible cases.  For example, consider the
following proposition involving prime numbers.  (A \emph{prime} is an
integer greater than~1 that is divisible only by itself and~1.  For
example, 2, 3, 5, 7, and~11 are primes, but 4, 6, and~9 are not.  A
number greater than~1 that is not prime is said to be
\emph{composite}.)
\begin{proposition}\label{41form}
For every nonnegative integer, $n$, the value of $n^2 + n + 41$ is prime.
\end{proposition}
It is not immediately clear whether this proposition is true or
false.  In such circumstances, it is tempting to try to determine its
veracity by computing the value of\footnote{The symbol \term{$\eqdef$} means
 ``equal by definition.''  It's always ok to simply write ``='' instead of
 $\eqdef$, but reminding the reader that an equality holds by definition
 can be helpful.}
\begin{equation}\label{pn41}
p(n) \eqdef  n^2 + n + 41.
\end{equation}
for several values of~$n$ and then checking to see if they are prime.
If any of the computed values is not prime, then we will know that the
proposition is false.  If all the computed values are indeed prime,
then we might be tempted to conclude that the proposition is true.

We begin the checking by evaluating $p(0) = 41$, which is prime.
$p(1) = 43$ is also prime.  So is $p(2) = 47$, $p(3)=53$, \dots, and
$p(20) = 461$, all of which are prime.  Hmmm\dots\ It is starting to
look like $p(n)$ is a prime for every nonnegative integer~$n$.  In
fact, continued checking reveals that $p(n)$ is prime for all $n \le
39$.
The proposition certainly does seem to be true.

But $p(40) = 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 41 \cdot 41$, which is not prime.  So
it's \emph{not} true that the expression is prime \emph{for all}
nonnegative integers, and thus the proposition is false!

Although surprising, this example is not as contrived or rare as you
might suspect.  As we will soon see, there are many examples of
propositions that seem to be true when you check a few cases (or even
many), but
which turn out to be false.  The key to remember is that you
can't check a claim about an infinite
set by checking a finite set of its elements, no matter how large the
finite set.

Propositions that involve \emph{all} numbers
are so common that there is a special notation for them.  For example,
Proposition~\ref{41form} can also be written as
\begin{equation}\label{pn}
\forall n \in \naturals.\; p(n) \text{ is prime}.
\end{equation}
Here the symbol \term{$\forall$} is read ``for all''.  The symbol
\term{$\naturals$} stands for the set of \emph{nonnegative integers},
namely, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots (ask your instructor for the complete list).
The symbol ``\term{$\in$}'' is read as ``is a member of,'' or
``belongs to,'' or simply as ``is in''.  The period after the
$\naturals$ is just a separator between phrases.

\iffalse
\begin{notesproblem}
Show that no nonconstant polynomial can map all nonnegative integers into
prime numbers.  (This can be proved using elementary algebra, but it's a
little tricky.  It will be easier to show after we study modular
arithmetic later in the term.)
\end{notesproblem}
\fi

Here is another example of a proposition that, at first, seems to be
true but which turns out to be false.
\begin{proposition}\label{a4}
$a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4$ has no solution when $a, b, c, d$ are positive
integers.
\end{proposition}
\idx{Euler} (pronounced ``oiler'') conjectured this proposition to be
true in~1769.  It was checked by humans and then by computers for many
values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and~$d$ over the next two centuries.
Ultimately the proposition was proven false in~1987 by Noam
\idx{Elkies}.  The solution he found was $a = 95800, b = 217519, c =
414560, d = 422481$.  No wonder it took 218 years to show the
proposition is false!

In logical notation, Proposition~\ref{a4} could be written,
\[
\forall a \in \posints\, \forall b \in \posints\, \forall c \in
\posints\, \forall d \in \posints.\; a^4 + b^4 + c^4 \neq d^4.
\]
Here, \term{$\posints$} is a symbol for the positive integers.
Strings of $\forall$'s are usually abbreviated for easier reading, as
follows:
\[
\forall a, b, c, d \in \posints.\; a^4 + b^4 + c^4 \neq d^4.
\]

The following proposition is even nastier.
\begin{proposition}
$313 (x^3 + y^3) = z^3$ has no solution when $x, y, z\in\posints$.
\end{proposition}

This proposition is also false, but the smallest counterexample values
for $x$, $y$, and~$z$ have more than 1000 digits!  Even the world's
largest computers would not be able to get that far with brute force.
Of course, you may be wondering why anyone would care whether or not
there is a solution to $313 (x^3 + y^3) = z^3$ where $x$, $y$, and~$z$
are positive integers.  It turns out that finding solutions to such
equations is important in the field of elliptic curves, which turns
out to be important to the study of factoring large integers, which
turns out (as we will see in Chapter~\ref{number_theory_chap}) to be
important in cracking commonly-used cryptosystems, which is why
mathematicians went to the effort to find the solution with thousands
of digits.  

Of course, not all propositions  that have infinitely many cases to
check turn out to be
false.  The following proposition (known as the ``Four-Color
Theorem'') turns out to be true.
\begin{proposition}\label{4colorprop}
Every map can be colored with 4 colors so that adjacent\footnote{Two
  regions are adjacent only when they share a boundary segment of
  positive length.  They are not considered to be adjacent if their
  boundaries meet only at a few points.} regions have different
colors.
\end{proposition}
The proof of this proposition is difficult and took over a century to
perfect.  Along the way, many incorrect proofs were proposed,
including one that stood for 10 years in the late 19th century before
the mistake was found.  An extremely laborious proof was finally found
in 1976 by mathematicians Appel and Haken, who used a complex computer
program to categorize the four-colorable maps; the program left a few
thousand maps uncategorized, and these were checked by hand by Haken
and his assistants---including his 15-year-old daughter.  There was a
lot of debate about whether this was a legitimate proof: the proof was
too big to be checked without a computer, and no one could guarantee
that the computer calculated correctly, nor did anyone have the energy
to recheck the four-colorings of the thousands of maps that were done by
hand.  Within the past decade, a mostly intelligible proof of the
Four-Color Theorem was found, though a computer is still needed to
check the colorability of several hundred special maps.\footnote{See
\href{http://www.math.gatech.edu/~thomas/FC/fourcolor.html}
{\texttt{http://www.math.gatech.edu/\~{}thomas/FC/fourcolor.html}}

The story of the Four-Color Proof is told in a well-reviewed
  popular (non-technical) book: ``Four Colors Suffice.  How the Map
  Problem was Solved.'' \emph{Robin Wilson}.  Princeton Univ. Press, 2003,
  276pp. ISBN 0-691-11533-8.}

In some cases, we do not know whether or not a proposition is true.
For example, the following simple proposition (known as Goldbach's
Conjecture) has been heavily studied since~1742 but we still do not
know if it is true.  Of course, it has been checked by computer for
many values of~$n$, but as we have seen, that is not sufficient to
conclude that it is true.
\begin{proposition}[Goldbach]
Every even integer~$n$ greater than~2 is the sum of two primes.
\end{proposition}

While the preceding propositions are important in mathematics,
computer scientists are often interested in propositions concerning
the ``correctness'' of programs and systems, to determine whether a
program or system does what it's supposed to do.  Programs are
notoriously buggy, and there's a growing community of researchers and
practitioners trying to find ways to prove program correctness.  These
efforts have been successful enough in the case of CPU chips that they
are now routinely used by leading chip manufacturers to prove chip
correctness and avoid mistakes like the notorious Intel division bug
in the 1990's.

Developing mathematical methods to verify programs and systems remains an
active research area.  We'll consider some of these methods later in the
text.

\subsection{Predicates}
A \term{predicate} is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of
one or more variables.  Most of the propositions above were defined in
terms of predicates.  For example,
%
\begin{center}
``$n$ is a perfect square''
\end{center}
%
is a predicate whose truth depends on the value of $n$.  The predicate is
true for $n = 4$ since four is a perfect square, but false for $n = 5$
since five is not a perfect square.  

Like other propositions, predicates are often named with a letter.
Furthermore, a function-like notation is used to denote a predicate
supplied with specific variable values.  For example, we might name
our earlier predicate $P$:
%
\[
P(n) \eqdef \text{``$n$ is a perfect square''}
\]
%
Now $P(4)$ is true, and $P(5)$ is false.

This notation for predicates is confusingly similar to ordinary function
notation.  If $P$ is a predicate, then $P(n)$ is either \textit{true} or
\textit{false}, depending on the value of $n$.  On the other hand, if $p$
is an ordinary function, like $n^2 + n$, then $p(n)$ is a
\textit{numerical quantity}.  \textbf{Don't confuse these two!}

\subsection{Quantifiers}

There are a couple of assertions commonly made about a predicate: that it
is \emph{sometimes} true and that it is \emph{always} true.  For
example, the predicate
%
\[
\text{``$x^2 \geq 0$''}
\]
%
is always true when $x$ is a real number.  On the other hand, the
predicate
%
\[
\text{``$5x^2 - 7 = 0$''}
\]
%
is only sometimes true; specifically, when $x = \pm \sqrt{7/5}$.

There are several ways to express the notions of ``always true'' and
``sometimes true'' in English.  The table below gives some general
formats on the left and specific examples using those formats on the
right.  You can expect to see such phrases hundreds of times in
mathematical writing!
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

All these sentences quantify how often the predicate is true.
Specifically, an assertion that a predicate is always true, is called
a \term{universally quantified} statement.  An assertion that a
predicate is sometimes true, is called an \term{existentially
  quantified} statement.

Sometimes English sentences are unclear about quantification:
%
\begin{center}
  ``If you can solve any problem we come up with, then you get an \emph{A}
  for the course.''
\end{center}
%
The phrase ``you can solve any problem we can come up with'' could
reasonably be interpreted as either a universal or existential
statement.  It might mean:
%
\begin{quote}
``You can solve \emph{every} problem we come up with,''
\end{quote}
or maybe
\begin{quote}
``You can solve \emph{at least one} problem we come up with.''
\end{quote}

In the preceding example, the quantified phrase appears inside a
larger if-then statement.  This is quite normal; quantified statements
are themselves propositions and can be combined with \QAND, \QOR,
\QIMPLIES, etc., just like any other proposition.

\subsection{More Notation}

There are symbols to represent universal and existential
quantification, just as there are symbols for ``$\QAND$'' ($\wedge$),
``$\QIMP$'' ($\implies$), and so forth.  In particular, to say
that a predicate, $P(x)$, is true for all values of $x$ in some set,
$D$, we write:
\begin{equation}\label{AxDPx}
\forall x \in D.\; P(x)
\end{equation}
The \term{universal quantifier} symbol $\forall$ is read ``for all,''
so this whole expression~\eqref{AxDPx} is read ``For all $x$ in $D$,
$P(x)$ is true.''  Remember that upside-down ``A'' stands for
``\textbf{A}ll.''

To say that a predicate $P(x)$ is true for at least one value of $x$
in $D$, we write:
\begin{equation}\label{ExDPx}
\exists x \in D.\; P(x)
\end{equation}
The \term{existential quantifier} symbol \term{$\exists$}, is read
``there exists.''  So expression~\eqref{ExDPx} is read, ``There exists
an $x$ in $D$ such that $P(x)$ is true.''  Remember that backward
``E'' stands for ``\textbf{E}xists.''

The symbols $\forall$ and $\exists$ are always followed by a
variable---typically with an indication of the set the variable ranges
over---and then a predicate, as in the two examples above.

As an example, let $\probs$ be the set of problems we come up with,
$\solves(x)$ be the predicate ``You can solve problem $x$'', and $G$ be
the proposition, ``You get an \emph{A} for the course.''  Then the two
different interpretations of
%
\begin{quote}
  ``If you can solve any problem we come up with, then you get an \emph{A}
  for the course.''
\end{quote}
can be written as follows:
\[
(\forall x \in \probs.\; \solves(x)) \QIMP G,
\]
or maybe
\[
(\exists x \in \probs.\; \solves(x)) \QIMP G.
\]

\subsection{Mixing Quantifiers}

Many mathematical statements involve several quantifiers.  For
example, \term{Goldbach's Conjecture} states:
%
\begin{center}
``Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.''
\end{center}
%
Let's write this more verbosely to make the use of quantification
clearer:
%
\begin{quote}
For every even integer $n$ greater than 2,
there exist primes $p$ and $q$ such that $n = p + q$.
\end{quote}
%
Let $\even$ be the set of even integers greater than 2, and let $\primes$ be the
set of primes.  Then we can write Goldbach's Conjecture in logic
notation as follows:
%
\[
\underbrace{\forall n \in \even.}_{\substack
    {\text{for every even} \\
     \text{integer $n > 2$}}}
\
\underbrace{\exists p \in \primes\ \exists q \in \primes.}_{\substack
    {\text{there exist primes} \\
     \text{$p$ and $q$ such that}}}
\ n = p + q.
\]
The proposition can also be written more simply as
\[
 \forall n \in \even.\, \exists p, q \in \primes. \; p + q = n.
\]

\subsection{Order of Quantifiers}

Swapping the order of different kinds of quantifiers (existential or
universal) usually changes the meaning of a proposition.  For example,
let's return to one of our initial, confusing statements:
\begin{center}
``Every American has a dream.''
\end{center}

This sentence is ambiguous because the order of quantifiers is
unclear.  Let $A$ be the set of Americans, let $D$ be the set of
dreams, and define the predicate $H(a, d)$ to be ``American $a$ has
dream $d$.''  Now the sentence could mean that there is a single dream
that every American shares:
\[
\exists\, d \in D.\, \forall a \in A.\; H(a, d)
\]
For example, it might be that every American shares the dream of owning
their own home.

Or it could mean that every American has a personal dream:
\[
\forall a \in A.\, \exists\, d \in D.\; H(a, d)
\]
For example, some Americans may dream of a peaceful retirement, while
others dream of continuing practicing their profession as long as they
live, and still others may dream of being so rich they needn't think at
all about work.

Swapping quantifiers in \idx{Goldbach's Conjecture} creates a patently false
statement; namely that every even number $\geq 2$ is the sum of \emph{the same}
two primes:
\[
\underbrace{\exists\, p, q \in \primes.}_{\substack
    {\text{there exist primes} \\
     \text{$p$ and $q$ such that}}}
\
\underbrace{\forall n \in \even.}_{\substack
    {\text{for every even} \\
     \text{integer $n > 2$}}}
\ n = p + q.
\]

\subsection{Variables Over One Domain}

When all the variables in a formula are understood to take values from the
same nonempty set, $D$, it's conventional to omit mention of $D$.  For
example, instead of $\forall x \in D\; \exists y \in D.\; Q(x,y)$ we'd
write $\forall x \exists y.\; Q(x,y)$.  The unnamed nonempty set that $x$
and $y$ range over is called the \term{domain of discourse}, or just plain
\term{domain}, of the formula.

It's easy to arrange for all the variables to range over one domain.  For
example, \idx{Goldbach's Conjecture} could be expressed with all variables
ranging over the domain $\naturals$ as
\[
\forall n.\, (n \in \even)\ \QIMP\ (\exists p\, \exists q. \; p \in \primes \QAND
q \in \primes \QAND n = p + q).
\]

\subsection{Negating Quantifiers}

There is a simple relationship between the two kinds of quantifiers.  The
following two sentences mean the same thing:
%
\begin{quote}

It is not the case that everyone likes to snowboard.

There exists someone who does not like to snowboard.

\end{quote}
%
In terms of logic notation, this follows from a general property of
predicate formulas:
%
\[
\QNOT \paren{\forall x.\; P(x)}
\quad \text{is equivalent to} \quad
\exists x.\, \QNOT(P(x)).
\]
%
Similarly, these sentences mean the same thing:
%
\begin{quote}
There does not exist anyone who likes skiing over magma.

Everyone dislikes skiing over magma.
\end{quote}
%
We can express the equivalence in logic notation this way:
%
\begin{equation}\label{nE}
\QNOT\paren{\exists x.\, P(x)}\  \QIFF\  \forall x.\, \QNOT(P(x)).
\end{equation}
%
The general principle is that \emph{moving a ``not'' across a
quantifier changes the kind of quantifier.}

\iffalse
Logicians have worked very hard to define strict rules for the
use of logic notation so that ideas can be expressed with absolute rigor.
It's all quite charming and clever.  However, the sad irony is that
applied mathematicians usually use their beloved notation as a crude
shorthand, breaking the rules and abusing the notation willy-nilly---sort
of like pounding nails with fine china.

\section{Validity}\label{sec:validity}

A propositional formula is called \term{valid} when it evaluates to \true\
no matter what truth values are assigned to the individual propositional
variables.  For example, the propositional version of the \idx{Distributive Law}
is that $P \QAND (Q \QOR R)$ is equivalent to $(P \QAND Q) \QOR (P \QAND
R)$.  This is the same as saying that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:distributive_law}
[P \QAND (Q \QOR R)] \QIFF [(P \QAND Q) \QOR (P \QAND R)]
\end{equation}
is valid.  This can be verified by checking the truth table for $P
\QAND (Q \QOR R)$ and $(P \QAND Q) \QOR (P \QAND R)$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}

P & Q & R & P \QAND (Q \QOR R) & (P \QAND Q) \QOR (P \QAND R) \\
\hline

\true & \true  & \true   & \true  & \true \\
\true & \true  & \false  & \true  & \true \\
\true & \false & \true   & \true  & \true \\
\true & \false & \false  & \false & \false \\

\false & \true  & \true  & \false & \false \\
\false & \true  & \false & \false & \false \\
\false & \false & \true  & \false & \false \\
\false & \false & \false & \false & \false

\end{array}
\end{equation*}

The same idea extends to predicate formulas, but to be valid, a
formula now must evaluate to true no matter what values its variables
may take over any unspecified domain, and no matter what
interpretation a predicate variable may be given.  For example, we
already observed that the rule for negating a quantifier is captured
by the valid assertion~\eqref{nE}.

Another useful example of a valid assertion is
\begin{equation}\label{eaimpliesae}
\exists x \forall y.\; P(x,y) \QIMP \forall y \exists x.\; P(x,y).
\end{equation}

Here's an explanation why this is valid:

\begin{quote}
Let $D$ be the domain for the variables and $P_0$ be some
\idx{binary predicate}\footnote{That is, a predicate that depends on two variables.}
on $D$.  We need to show that if
\begin{equation}\label{exayp0}
\exists x \in D\; \forall y \in D.\; P_0(x,y)
\end{equation}
holds under this interpretation, then so does
\begin{equation}\label{ayexp0}
\forall y \in D\; \exists x \in D.\; P_0(x,y).
\end{equation}
So suppose~\eqref{exayp0} is true.  Then by definition of $\exists$, this
means that some element $d_0 \in D$ has the property that
\[
\forall y \in D.\, P_0(d_0, y).
\]
By definition of $\forall$, this means that
\[
P_0(d_0,d)
\]
is true for all $d \in D$.  So given any $d \in D$, there is an element in
$D$, namely, $d_0$, such that $P_0(d_0,d)$ is true.  But that's exactly
what~\eqref{ayexp0} means, so we've proved that~\eqref{ayexp0} holds under
this interpretation, as required.
\end{quote}

We hope this is helpful as an explanation, although purists would not
really want to call it a ``proof.''  The problem is that with something as basic
as~\eqref{eaimpliesae}, it's hard to see what more elementary axioms are
ok to use in proving it.  What the explanation above did was translate the
logical formula~\eqref{eaimpliesae} into English and then appeal to the
meaning, in English, of ``for all'' and ``there exists'' as justification.

In contrast to~\eqref{eaimpliesae}, the formula
\begin{equation}\label{aenotimplyea}
\forall y \exists x.\; P(x,y) \QIMP \exists x \forall y.\; P(x,y).
\end{equation}
is \emph{not} valid.  We can prove this by describing an
interpretation where the hypothesis, $\forall y \exists x.\; P(x,y)$, is
true but the conclusion, $\exists x \forall y.\; P(x,y)$, is not true.
For example, let the domain be the integers and $P(x,y)$ mean $x > y$.
Then the hypothesis would be true because, given a value, $n$, for $y$ we
could, for example, choose the value of $x$ to be $n+1$.  But under this
interpretation the conclusion asserts that there is an integer that is
bigger than all integers, which is certainly false.  An interpretation
like this which falsifies an assertion is called a \term{counter model} to
the assertion.

\section{Satisfiability}\label{SAT_sec}

A proposition is \textbf{satisfiable} if some setting of the variables
makes the proposition true.  For example, $P \QAND \bar{Q}$ is
satisfiable because the expression is true if $P$ is true or $Q$ is
false.  On the other hand, $P \QAND \bar{P}$ is not satisfiable because
the expression as a whole is false for both settings of $P$.  But
determining whether or not a more complicated proposition is satisfiable
is not so easy.  How about this one?
%
\[
(P \QOR Q \QOR R) \QAND (\bar P \QOR \bar Q)
                  \QAND (\bar P \QOR \bar R)
                  \QAND (\bar R \QOR \bar Q)
\]

The general problem of deciding whether a proposition is satisfiable
is called \term{SAT}.  One approach to SAT is to construct a truth
table and check whether or not a $\true$ ever appears.  But this
approach is not very efficient; a proposition with $n$ variables has a
truth table with $2^n$ lines, so the effort required to decide about a
proposition grows \idx{exponentially} with the number of variables.
For a proposition with just 30 variables, that's already over a
billion lines to check!

Is there a more \textit{efficient} solution to SAT?  In particular, is
there some, presumably very ingenious, procedure that determines in a
number of steps that grows \emph{polynomially}---like $n^2$ or
$n^{14}$---instead of exponentially, whether any given proposition is
satisfiable or not?  No one knows.  And an awful lot hangs on the
answer.  An efficient solution to SAT would immediately imply
efficient solutions to many, many other important problems involving
packing, scheduling, routing, and circuit verification, among other
things.  This would be wonderful, but there would also be worldwide
chaos.  Decrypting coded messages would also become an easy task (for
most codes).  Online financial transactions would be insecure and
secret communications could be read by everyone.

Recently there has been exciting progress on \term{sat-solvers} for
practical applications like digital circuit verification.  These
programs find satisfying assignments with amazing efficiency even for
formulas with millions of variables.  Unfortunately, it's hard to
predict which kind of formulas are amenable to sat-solver methods, and
for formulas that are NOT satisfiable, sat-solvers generally take
exponential time to verify that.

So no one has a good idea how to solve SAT in polynomial time, or how
to prove that it can't be done---researchers are completely stuck.
The problem of determining whether or not SAT has a polynomial time
solution is known as the ``\textbf{P} vs.\ \textbf{NP}'' problem.  It
is the outstanding unanswered question in theoretical computer
science.  It is also one of the
seven \href{http://www.claymath.org/millennium/}{Millenium Problems}:
the Clay Institute will award you \$1,000,000 if you solve
the \textbf{P} vs.\ \textbf{NP} problem.
