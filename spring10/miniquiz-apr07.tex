\subsection*{Matched Brackets}

  Recursively define the set, $\text{MB}$, of strings of ``matching'' brackets
  as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Base case:} $\emptystring \in \text{MB}$.

\item \textbf{Constructor case:} If $s,t \in \text{MB}$, then
  $\mtt{[}s\mtt{]}t \in \text{MB}$.

\end{itemize}
