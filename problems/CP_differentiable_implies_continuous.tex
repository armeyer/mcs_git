\begin{problem}
When the mathematician says to his student, ``If a function is not
continuous, then it is not differentiable,'' then letting $D$ stand for
``differentiable'' and $C$ for continuous, the only proper translation of the
mathematician's statement would be
\[
\QNOT(C)\ \QIMP\ \QNOT(D),
\]
or equivalently,
\[
D\ \QIMP\ C.
\]

But when a mother says to her son, ``If you don't do your homework, then
you can't watch TV,'' then letting $T$ stand for ``can watch TV'' and $H$ for
``do your homework,'' a reasonable translation of the mother's statement would
be
\[
\QNOT(H)\ \QIFF\ \QNOT(T),
\]
or equivalently,
\[
H\ \QIFF\ T.
\]

Explain why it is reasonable to translate these two IF-THEN statements in
different ways into propositional formulas.

\begin{staffnotes}
If a discussion about the watching TV and homework doesn't get going
on its own, ask students to come up with rationales for both the
$\QIFF$ and the $\QIMP$ interpretations, like those below for example.

\end{staffnotes}


\begin{solution}
We know that a differentiable function must be continuous, so
  when a function is not continuous, it is also not differentiable.  Now
  mathematicians use $\QIMP$ in the technical way given by its truth table.
  In particular, if a function \emph{is} continuous then to a
  mathematician, the implication
\[
\QNOT(C)\ \QIMP\ \QNOT(D),
\]
is automatically true since the hypothesis (left-hand side of the IMPLIES)
is false.  So whether or not continuity holds, the mathematician could
comfortably assert the $\QIMP$ statement knowing it is correct.

And of course a mathematician does \emph{not} mean $\QIFF$, since she
knows a function that is not differentiable may well be continuous.

On the other hand, while the mother certainly means that her son cannot
watch TV if he does not do his homework, both she and her son \emph{most
  likely} understand that if he \emph{does} do his homework, then he
\emph{will} be allowed watch TV.  In this case, even though the Mother
uses an IF-THEN phrasing, she really means $\QIFF$.

But circumstances in the household might instead be that the boy may
watch TV when he has not only done his homework, but \emph{also}
cleaned up his room.  In this case, just doing homework would not
imply being allowed to watch TV---the boy won't be allowed to watch TV
if he hasn't cleaned his room, even if he has done his homework, so in
this case the Mother really means $\QIMPLIES$.

The general point here is that semantics (meaning) trumps syntax
(sentence structure).  Even though the mathematician's and mother's
statements have the same structure, their meaning may warrant
different translations into precise logical language.
