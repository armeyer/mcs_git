\begin{problem}
  A subset of the nonnegative integers \nngint\ is called
  \emph{lonely} when it doesn't contain any pair of consecutive
  integers.  For example, the set $\set{1,5,25,125,\dots}$ of powers
  of $5$ is lonely, but the set of primes $\set{2,3,5,7,11,\dots}$ is
  not lonely because it contains both $2$ and $3$.

  Let $L$ be the set of lonely subsets of $\nngint$.  Show that $L$ is
  uncountable.
\end{problem}

\inhandout{\hint Instead of the standard diagonal with slope -1, try
  one with slope -1/2; alternatively, describe a \inj\ or
  \surj\ relation with $\power(\nngint)$.}

\begin{solution}
 
  \begin{proof}
   We'll argue by diagonalization with slope -1/2 as in
   Problem~\bref{PS_off_diagonal_arguments}.  For the sake of
   contradiction, assume $L$ is countable.  Since $L$ is certainly
   infinite, it must have a bijection with $\nngint$, so we can write
   $L = \set{s_0, s_1, s_2, \dots}$.  Define a new subset
   $t \subset \nngint$ of \emph{only even integers} as follows:
   \[
   t \eqdef \set{2n \suchthat n \in \nngint \QAND 2n \notin s_n}.
   \]
   Because $t$ only has even integers, it is lonely and so is in $L$.
   On the other hand, $t \ne s_k$ for $k\in\nngint$, because one of
   $t$ and $s_k$ contains $2k$ and the other does not, by
   construction.  Thus, $t\notin \set{s_0,s_1,s_2,\dots}$, that is,
   $t\notin L$.  This is a contradiction, so our assumption that $L$
   is countable must be false, proving that $L$ is uncountable.
  \end{proof}

  A similar, alternate proof does not rely on diagonalization at all.

  \begin{proof}
   We'll show that $\powN \inj L$, which suffices because we already
   know that $\powN$ is uncountable.  Define the function $g:\powN\to
   L$ that simply doubles all entries of a given set: for any
   $s \subseteq \nngint$,
   \[
   g(s) \eqdef \set{2k \suchthat k\in s}.
   \]
   The function $g$ is total by definition, and the set $g(s)$
   contains only even integers and therefore belongs to $L$.
   Furthermore, $g$ is injective, because if $s,t \subseteq \nngint$
   are different, then there is some integer $n$ with $n\in
   s\ \QIFF\ n\notin t$, which implies $2n \in g(s)\ \QIFF\ 2n \notin
   g(t)$, and therefore $g(s)\ne g(t)$.  So $g$ is a total injective
   relation, which proves the claim that $\powN \inj L$.
  \end{proof}
\end{solution}
