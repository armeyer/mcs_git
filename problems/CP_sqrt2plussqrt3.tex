\begin{problem}
Prove by contradiction that $\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

\hint $(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2})$

\begin{solution}
Following the hint, we observe
\[
(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2})=1.
\]
Now assuming for the sake of contradiction that $\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}$
is a rational number $m/n$ for integers $m,n$, we conclude that
$\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}$ equals $n/m$ and therefore is also rational.
But
\[
\frac{1}{2}\paren{(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}) - (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2})} = \sqrt{2},
\]
and since the difference and product of rational numbers is rational,
we conclude that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, \inhandout{which we know it
  is not}\inbook{contradicting Theorem~\bref{thm:sqrt2irr_by_contra}}.
So $\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}$ must be irrational.
\end{solution}
