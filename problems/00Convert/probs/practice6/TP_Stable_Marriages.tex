\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Stable Marriages

Having pulled through the MIT 6.042 experience together three girls
and three guys decide that the future looks brighter now and so they
decide to get married, but each one has a list of preferences:
           
Girls:
\begin{description}
\item[A] Ashley, with order of preference: Z X Y

\item[B] Betty, with order of preference: Z Y X

\item[C] Cathy, with order of preference: Y Z X
\end{description}
           
Guys:
\begin{description}           
\item[X] Xavier, with order of preference: B C A

\item[Y] Yanos, with order of preference: A C B

\item[Z] Zachary, with order of preference: B A C
\end{description}

You, as a marriage counselor, have to match them so that they can live
happily ever after---that is, find a set of marriages that is
\emph{stable}.

% Type in your answer in the form (A X) (B Y) (C Z), wife followed by a
% husband.

\begin{solution}

(A X) (B Z) (C Y)

(A Y) (B Z) (C X)


(A X) (B Z) (C Y) is the matching that we get if we run the stable
  marriage algorithm using the girls as suitors; namely, this is the
  girl-optimal solution.  If we run the algorithm using the boys as
  suitors, we get the matching (A Y) (B Z) (C X); this the boy-optimal
  solution.
\end{solution}
