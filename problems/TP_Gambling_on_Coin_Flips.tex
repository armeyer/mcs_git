\begin{problem}
I have \$30 and you have \$90.  When the flip of a fair coin comes up
Heads, I pay you \$1, and when it comes up Tails, you pay me \$1.  We
keep flipping until one of us runs out of money.  What is the
probability that I run out of money first?

\begin{solution}
3/4

This is the same as the probability that the Gambler reaches his goal
in the unbiased game starting with \$90 and aiming for a goal of
$\$(30+90)$, so the answer is the quotient of initial capital and goal
amount, namely, $90/(30+90)= 3/4$.
\end{solution}
