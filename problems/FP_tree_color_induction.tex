\begin{problem}
Using colors red, white and blue, prove \emph{by induction} that there
are $3\cdot 2^{n-1}$ different 3-colorings\inhandout{\footnote{That
    is, an assignment of one of three possible colors to each vertex
    so that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color.}} of
any tree with $n$ vertices.

\inhandout{
As usual, carefully indicate your
\begin{itemize}
\item induction hypothesis
\item base case(s)
\item induction step.
\end{itemize}
}

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
By induction on the number $n$ of vertices.  The induction hypothesis is

$P(n) \eqdef$ For all $n$-vertex trees $T$ there are $3\cdot 2^{n-1}$ different 3-colorings of $T$.

\inductioncase{Base case}: ($n=1$).  There are $3 = 3 \cdot
2^{1-1}$ ways to color one vertex.

\inductioncase{Induction step}: Let $T$ be a tree with $(n+1)$
vertices for some $n \geq 1$.  Let $v$ be a leaf of $T$.  Then
removing $v$ and its incident edge, we obtain a tree $T-v$ with $n$
vertices.

We may assume by induction hypthesis $P(n)$ that there are $3 \cdot
2^{n-1}$ 3-colorings of $T-v$.  Each such 3-ooloring of $T-v$ can be
extended to a 3-ooloring of $T$ by assigning $v$ to have one of the
two colors that differs from the color of its father.  So there are $2
(3 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 3 \cdot 2^n = 3\cdot 2^{(n+1)-1}$ colorings of $T$,
which proves $P(n+1)$.
\end{proof}
