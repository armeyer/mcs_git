\begin{problem}

\bparts

\ppart Show that if a connected planar graph with more than two vertices
is bipartite, then
\begin{equation}\label{e2v-4}
e \leq 2v -4.
\end{equation}

\hint Similar to the proof that for planar
graphs $e \leq 3v-6$.

\begin{solution}
  By Problem~\ref{planar-structural}.\ref{structind-face-length},
%\bref{CP_planar_structural_induction}.\bref{structind-face-length},
  every face is of length at least 3.  But in a bipartite graph there
  are no cycles of odd length, so all must be of length at least 4.

  Each edge is included in exactly two faces, so
  \begin{equation}\label{4f}
    2e = \sum_{f \in\text{ faces}} \text{length}(f) \geq
    \sum_{f \in\text{ faces}} 4 = 4f.
  \end{equation}
  By Euler's formula, $f = e-v+2$, so
  substituting for $f$ in~\eqref{4f}, yields
\[
2e \geq 4(e-v+2),
\]
which simplifies to~\eqref{e2v-4}.

\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude that that $K_{3,3}$ is not planar.  ($K_{3,3}$ is the
graph with six vertices and an edge from each of the first three vertices
to each of the last three.)

\begin{solution}
$K_{3,3}$ is bipartite and connected. Also, it has 9 edges and 6
vertices, and since $9 > 8 = 2 \cdot 6 - 4$, it does not
satisfy~\eqref{e2v-4}, and so cannot be planar.
\end{solution}
