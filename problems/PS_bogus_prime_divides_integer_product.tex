\begin{problem}
  The following Lemma is true, but the \emph{proof} given for it below is
  defective.  Pinpoint \emph{exactly} where the proof first makes an
  unjustified step and explain why it is unjustified.

\begin{lemma*}
For any prime $p$ and positive integers $n, x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n$, if
$p \divides x_1x_2\dots x_n$, then $p \divides x_i$ for some $1\leq i\leq n$.
\end{lemma*}

\begin{bogusproof}
Proof by strong induction on $n$.  The induction hypothesis $P(n)$
is that Lemma holds for $n$.

\textbf{Base case} $n= 1$: When $n=1$, we have $p\divides x_1$, therefore
we can let $i=1$ and conclude $p\divides x_i$.

\textbf{Induction step}: Now assuming the claim holds for all $k\leq n$, we must
prove it for $n+1$.

So suppose $p\divides x_1x_2\cdots x_{n+1}$.  Let $y_n = x_n x_{n+1}$, so
$x_1x_2\cdots x_{n+1} = x_1x_2\cdots x_{n-1}y_n$.  Since the right-hand
side of this equality is a product of $n$ terms, we have by induction that
$p$ divides one of them.  If $p\divides x_i$ for some $i < n$, then we have the
desired $i$.  Otherwise $p\divides y_n$.  But since $y_n$ is a product of the two
terms $x_n, x_{n+1}$, we have by strong induction that $p$ divides one of
them.  So in this case $p \divides  x_i$ for $i = n$ or $i = n+1$.
\end{bogusproof}

\begin{solution}
Notice that nowhere in the proof is the fact that $p$ is prime
used.  So if this proof were correct, the Lemma would hold not just for
prime $p$, but for any positive integer $p$.  But of course, the Lemma is
false when $p$ is not prime, for example if $p=6$, $x_1=3$ and $x_2=4$, we
have $p\divides x_1x_2$ but $\QNOT(p \divides x_1)$ and $\QNOT(p \divides
x_2)$.  So there has to be something wrong somewhere.

The statement ``we have by strong induction that $p$ divides one of
them'' is the place where the proof breaks down: it appeals to strong
induction to justify applying the induction hypothesis for $2=k\leq
n$.  But the base case was $n=1$, so we can't assume $2 \leq
n$.\footnote{This special case was hidden by the use of three dots:
  $\cdots$.  Three dots tells a reader that there is a pattern which
  the author thinks should be obvious.  So be warned: when you see the
  dots, make sure you see the pattern and how the pattern applies even
  in the extreme cases.}

Note that the reasoning above is fine for every $n\geq 2$, so the
whole proof would be fine if we had an argument to prove the claim for
$n+1=2$.

Now in fact, if a prime, $p$ divides $x_1x_2$, it must divide $x_1$ or
$x_2$; this fact is obvious if we assume the uniqueness of prime
factorizations of integers, but the proof here never made use of this
fact.  An elementary proof of this fact appears in the chapter on
number theory.

Notice that uniqueness of prime factorization is a much more general
result than the simple Lemma here.  This Lemma is even needed in the
usual proof about prime factorization, so appealing to it to prove
this Lemma would be circular.
