\begin{problem}
Let $X$ be a random variable with uniform distribution over the
integers from $-n$ to $n$.  Let $Y ::= X^{2}$. Determine whether each
of the following statements is true or false.  Justify your answers
briefly.

\begin{enumerate}
 
\item $\expect{X} = 0$
 
\item $\expect{Y} = 0$
 
\item $\expect{Y} > \expect{X}$
 
\item $\expect{X+Y} = \expect{X} + \expect{Y}$

\item $\expect{XY} = \expect{X} \expect{Y}$
 
\item $X$, $Y$ are independent variables.

\item $\variance{X} = 0$
 
\item $\variance{Y} = 0$

\end{enumerate}

% Give you answer as a sequence of numbers separated by spaces (e.g.,
% ``6 2 4 ``).

\begin{solution}

1. True.  Since the \pdf\ of $X$ is symmetric around 0, we know the
mean has to be 0.

2. False.  All values of $Y$ are nonnegative and some of them are
actually positive with non-zero probability.  So there is no way for
the mean to be 0.  It has to be some positive value.

3. True.  Obvious from our answers to 1 and 2.

4. True.  By linearity of expectation, no matter what $X$ and $Y$ we
are actually talking about.

5. True.  This is tricky: the equation does not hold in general for
non-independent $X$ and $Y$.  However, in this particular case, it
happens to hold.  To see this, note that the right-hand side is 0, by
our answer to part $1$.  At the same time, the variable $XY$ is simply
$X^{3}$. So, its \pdf\ is symmetric around $0$ (the same way the
\pdf\ of $X$ is).  Therefore, its mean has to be $0$ as well.

6. False.  For example, without any knowledge about $X$, there is some
non-zero probability for $Y$ to be $n^{2}$.  However, if we know that
$X=0$, then the probability that $Y=n^{2}$ becomes $0$.

7.  False.  Variance is zero only for for random variables that are
constant.  $X$ is not constant.

8.  False.  Variance is zero only for for random variables that are
constant.  $Y$ is also not constant.
