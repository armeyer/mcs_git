\begin{problem}
Find an integer $k > 1$ such that $n$ and $n^k$ agree in their last three
digits whenever $n$ is divisible by neither 2 nor 5.

\solution{
  Two numbers agree in their last three digits iff they are congruent
  modulo 1000.  So we must find a $k > 1$ such that
\[
n \equiv n^k \pmod{1000}
\]
for all $n$ not divisible by 2 or 5 --that is, for all $n$ relatively prime to
1000.  But by Euler's theorem, we know $k = \phi(1000)+1$ will work, namely,
\[
k = \phi(1000)+1 = \phi(2^3)\phi(5^3) +1 = 4\cdot 100 + 1 = 401.
\]
