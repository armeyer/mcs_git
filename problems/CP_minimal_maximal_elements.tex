\ppart What are the maxim\emph{al} and minim\emph{al} elements, if
any, of the set, $\naturals$, of all nonnegative integers under
divisibility?  Is there a minim\emph{um} or maxim\emph{um} element?

\solution{The minimum (and therefore unique minimal) element is 1 since 1
divides all natural numbers. The maximum (and therefore unique maximal)
element is 0 since all numbers divide 0.}

\ppart What are the minimal and maximal elements, if any, of the set
of integers greater than 1 under divisibility?

\solution{All prime numbers are minimal elements, since no numbers divide
them.

There is no maximal element, because for any $n > 1$, there is  a
``larger'' number under the divisibility partial order, namely,
$mn$, for any $m > 1$.}

\ppart
What is the size of the longest chain that is guaranteed to exist in any
partially ordered set of $n>0$ elements?  What about the largest antichain?

\solution{
Chain size is 1 in the empty relation on a set of any size, since no two
elements are comparable.  Antichain size is 1 if the whole partial
order is a chain.
}

\ppart Describe a partially ordered set that has no minimal or maximal
elements.

\solution{$\integers$, $\reals$, etc.}

\ppart Describe a partially ordered set that has a \emph{unique minimal}
element, but no minimum element. \hint It will have to be infinite.

\solution{ $\integers \union \set{i}$ where $i$ is a root of $-1$, under
  the usual order $\integers$.  So $i$ is incomparable to everything but
  itself, and is therefore minimal.  }
