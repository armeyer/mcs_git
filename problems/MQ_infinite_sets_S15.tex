\begin{problem}
% Tests understanding of infinite sets

Prove that the set $S$ of all ordered triples of positive integers is countable:
\[
S = \set{(a, b, c) \suchthat  a,b,c \in \integers^+}.
\]

\begin{staffnotes}
\hint You might find inspiration from a class problem where you showed
that the set of pairs is countable.
