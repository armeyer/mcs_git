\begin{problem}
Find closed-form expressions for the following sums.

\bparts

\ppart

\[
\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{9^i - 7^i}{11^i}
\]

\solution{Split the expression into two geometric series and then
apply the formula for the sum of a geometric series.
%
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{9^i - 7^i}{11^i}
    & = \sum_{i=0}^n \left(\frac{9}{11}\right)^i -
        \sum_{i=0}^n \left(\frac{7}{11}\right)^i \\
    & = \frac{1 - \left(\frac{9}{11}\right)^{n+1}}{1 - \frac{9}{11}}
          - \frac{1 - \left(\frac{7}{11}\right)^{n+1}}{1 - \frac{7}{11}} \\
    & = - \frac{11}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{9}{11}\right)^{n+1}
        + \frac{11}{4} \cdot \left(\frac{7}{11}\right)^{n+1}
        + \frac{11}{4}
\end{align*}

\ppart

\[
\sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^m 3^{i+j}
\]

\solution{
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^m 3^{i+j}
    & = \sum_{i=0}^n \left(3^i \cdot \sum_{j=0}^m 3^j\right) \\
    & = \left(\sum_{j=0}^m 3^j\right) \cdot \left(\sum_{i=0}^n 3^i\right)\\
    & = \left(\frac{3^{m+1} - 1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\right)
\end{align*}
}


\ppart
\[
\sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} j^{5/3} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2 j^{1/3}}\right)^i
\]

\solution{
This fearsome-looking sum is a paper tiger; we just apply
the formula for the sum of a geometric series followed by the formula
for the sum of an arithmetic series.
%
\begin{align*}
\sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} j^{5/3} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2 j^{1/3}}\right)^i
    & = \sum_{j=1}^n j^{5/3} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{2 j^{1/3}}\right)} \\
    & = \sum_{j=1}^n 2j^2 \\
    & = \frac{2n (n+\frac{1}{2})(n+1)}{3}
\end{align*}
