\begin{problem}
  Let 
\[
S_k = 1^k + 2^k + \dots + p^k,
\]
where $p$ is an odd prime and $k$ is a positive multiple of $p - 1$.
Find $a \in \Zintvco{0}{p}$ and $b \in \Zintvoc{(-p)}{0}$ such that
\[
S_k \equiv a \equiv b \pmod{p}.
\]

\begin{solution}
By Fermat's Theorem, $x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$
when $1 \leq x \leq p - 1$.  Since $k$ is a multiple of $p-1$,
raising each side to a suitable power proves that $x^k \equiv 1
\pmod{p}$.  Also, since $k$ is positive, $p^k \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$.

Thus:
\begin{align*}
S_k & \equiv 1^k + 2^k + \dots + (p-1)^k + p^k \pmod{p} \\
    & \equiv \underbrace{1 + 1 + \dots + 1}_{\text{$p-1$ terms}} 
+ 0 \pmod{p} \\
    & = a \eqdef p - 1\pmod{p} \\
    & \equiv b \eqdef - 1 \pmod{p}.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
