\begin{problem}

Indicate which of the following relations below are equivalence
relations, (\textbf{E}), strict partial orders (\textbf{St}), weak
partial orders (\textbf{W}).  For each partial order, also indicate
whether it is \emph{linear} (\textbf{L}).

If a relation is none of the above, indicate whether it is

\emph{transitive} (\textbf{T}), \qquad  \emph{symmetric}
(\textbf{Sym}), \qquad  \emph{asymmetric} (\textbf{A}) \qquad
\emph{none of these} (\textbf{N})
