COPIED FROM S15

Conditional Probability, Ch. 17-17.5

In Spring '13, most teams finished 20 or more minutes early, mainly
because staff was not adequately briefed to get discussions going as
directed in individual problems.  Also,
PS\_conditional\_probability\_problem\_errors did not make it into the
actual handout used in class.
