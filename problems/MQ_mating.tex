\begin{problem}

In the Mating Ritual, suppose Tiger is one of the boys and Elin is one
of the girls.  Mark each of the following properties that must be
preserved invariants?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Tiger is Elin's only suitor.

\item Tiger is Elin's favorite suitor.

\item\label{onlygirl} Elin is the only girl on Tiger's list.

\item\label{opttop} Tiger's optimal wife is the top girl on his list.

\item\label{basicinv} If Elin is not on Tiger's list, then Elin has a suitor that she prefers to Tiger.

\item Elin does not have any boys serenading her.

\item\label{crossprefer} Elin has been crossed off Tiger's list, and
  Tiger prefers her to whomever he is serenading.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
The statements that are preserved invariants in general
are~\eqref{onlygirl}, \eqref{opttop}, \eqref{basicinv},
and~\eqref{crossprefer}.
\end{solution}
