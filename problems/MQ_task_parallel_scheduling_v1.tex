\begin{problem}
Let $\set{A, ..., H}$ be a set of tasks that we must complete.  The
following DAG describes which tasks must be done before others, where
there is an arrow from $S$ to $T$ iff $S$ must be done before $T$.

\ppart
Write the longest antichain.
\begin{solution}
A, B, C
\end{solution}
\examspace[3cm]

\ppart If we allow parallel scheduling, and each task takes 1 minute
to complete, what is the minimum amount of time needed to complete all
tasks?

\begin{solution}
This should be the length of the longest chain, 4 minutes.
\end{solution}
