\problempart
  Suppose two identical 52-card decks\footnote{Standard decks of playing
  cards, without jokers.} are mixed together.  Write a
  simple expression for the number of different arrangements of the 104 cards that 
  could possibly result from such a mixing.

\examspace[3in]

\begin{solution}
In the mixed deck, there are precisely two copies of each of 52 distinct cards.
By the Bookkeeper Rule and the definition of multinomial coefficients, the 
number of possible arrangements of cards in the mixed deck is therefore just 
%  If the cards were all distinct, there would be $104!$ ``distinct" mixes.
%  Call two distinct mixes \emph{similar} if they differ only in that the
%  positions of the two distinct copies of the same card are exchanged.  So
%  two distinct mixes correspond to the same double-deck mix iff they are
%  similar.  Therefore, the map from distinct mixes to double-deck mixes is
%  $(2!)^{52}$ to one, and so by the division rule, there are
\[
\frac{104!}{(2!)^{52}}.
\]
\end{solution}

\problempart Using only integers from the interval $\Zintv{1}{n}$, how
many different \textbf{strictly increasing} length-$m$ sequences can
be formed?

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{n}{m}
\]

\textbf{Justification:} Given any $m$-element subset of $\set{1,2,...,n}$, listing its elements in increasing order yields a 
sequence that is strictly increasing and has length $m$.  By collecting in a set the terms of any strictly increasing length-$m$ sequence whose
terms have been drawn from $\set{1,2,...,n}$, an $m$-element subset of $\set{1,2,...,n}$ is formed.  Thus there is a bijection between the set 
of all strictly increasing length-$m$ sequences with terms drawn from $\set{1,2,...,n}$
and the set of all size-$m$ subsets of $\set{1,2,...,n}$.  

%This could also be done via bijection with $0^{a_1} 1 0^{a_2} 1$ \dots $0^{a_m} 1 0^k$ with $k$ chosen so the number of 0's is $n-m$.
