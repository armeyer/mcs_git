\begin{problem}

%% type: multi-part
%% title: Summation

There is a number~$a$ such that
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{i=1}^\infty i^p
\end{equation*}
converges to a finite value iff $p < a$.

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Value of <em>a</em>

What is the value of \emph{a}?

\begin{solution}
-1
\end{solution}

\ppart
%% type: short-answer
%% title: Proof

Which of the following would be good approaches as part of a proof
that this value of~$a$ is correct ?

\begin{enumerate}

\item find a closed form for 
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^\infty x^p \, dx
\end{equation*}

\item find a closed form for 
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^\infty i^x \, dx
\end{equation*}

\item induction on $p$

\item induction on $n$ using the following sum 
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{i=1}^n i^p
\end{equation*}

\item compare the series term-by-term with the Harmonic series

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

1 is correct: the sum is $\Theta\left(\int_1^\infty x^p \, dx \right)$.

For $p \neq -1$, the indefinite integral is

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{x^{p+1}}{p+1}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}

\item
If $p < -1$, then $p+1 < 0$, so $\lim_{x\to \infty} x^{p+1} = 0$, and
the definite integral from 1 to~$\infty$ evaluates to $-1/(p+1)$.
Hence the sum is bounded from above, and since it is increasing, it
has a finite limit, that is, it converges.

\item
If $p > -1$, then $p+1 > 0$, so $\lim_{x \to \infty} x^{p+1} =
\infty$, and the definite integral diverges.

\item
For $p = -1$ the indefinite integral is $\log x$ which also
approaches~$\infty$ as $x$ approaches~$\infty$, so the the definite
integral also diverges.

\end{itemize}

4 is incorrect:

This would need the ideas from the good approaches to handle the
induction step anyway, at which point the induction would be moot.

5 is correct:

For $p = -1, the$ sum is the harmonic series which we know does not
converge. Since the term $i^{p}$ is increasing in~$p$ for $i > 1$, the
sum will be larger, and hence also diverge for~$p > -1$.
\end{solution}
