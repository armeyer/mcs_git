\begin{problem}
Let $H_3$ be the graph shown in Figure~\ref{fig:H3}.  Explain why it
is impossible to find two spanning trees of $H_3$ that have no edges
in common.
\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic[width=0.3\linewidth]{MQ_H3}
\caption{$H_3$\,.\label{fig:H3}}
\end{figure}

%\hint Count vertices \& edges.

\begin{solution}
$H_3$ has 8 vertices, so any spanning tree must have $8-1=7$
  edges. But $H_3$ has only 12 edges, so any two sets of 7 edges must
  overlap.
\end{solution}
