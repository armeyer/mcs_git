\begin{problem}
  \href{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulersSumofPowersConjecture.html}{\emph{Euler's
      Conjecture}} in 1769 was that there are no positive integer
  solutions to the equation
\[
a^4 + b^4 + c^4 =  d^4.
\]
Integer values for $a,b,c,d$ that do satisfy this equation were first
discovered in 1986.  So Euler guessed wrong, but it took more than two
centuries to demonstrate his mistake.

Now let's consider Lehman's equation, similar to Euler's but with some
coefficients:
\begin{equation}\label{lehman-eqn}
8 a^4 + 4 b^4 + 2 c^4 = d^4
\end{equation}

Prove that Lehman's equation~\eqref{lehman-eqn} really does not have any positive
integer solutions.

\hint Consider the minimum value of $a$ among all possible solutions
to~\eqref{lehman-eqn}.

\begin{staffnotes}
Students are sometimes sloppy about using WOP here and talk about
``the minimum solution to equation~\eqref{lehman-eqn}.''  But a
\emph{solution} is a vector $(a,b,c,d) \in \paren{\integers^+}^4$, and
the WOP does not apply directly.  (There are various ways to salvage
the idea of a minimum solution, for example, by considering the
minimum value of the sum of the coordinates, but it's best not to go
there.)
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
Suppose that there exists a solution.  Then there must be a
  solution in which $a$ has the smallest possible value.  We will show
  that, in this solution $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ must all be even.
  However, we can then obtain another solution over the positive integers
  with a smaller $a$ by dividing $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ in half.  This is
  a contradiction, and so no solution exists.

All that remains is to show that $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ must all be even.
The left side of Lehman's equation is even, so $d^4$ is even, so $d$ must
be even.
\begin{staffnotes}
Make sure students notice that 
\[
[d^4\  \text{even}] \QIMP\ d\  \text{even}
\]
requires some justification.  After all, $8 \divides 2^4$ but
$\QNOT(8^2 \divides 2^4)$.  In general, facts like this require appeal
to the Unique Factorization Theorem, as explained in
Problem~\bref{CP_generalize_root_2_proof}.
\end{staffnotes}
  Substituting $d = 2 d'$ into Lehman's equation gives:

\begin{equation}
8 a^4 + 4 b^4 + 2 c^4 = 16 d'^4
\end{equation}

Now $2 c^4$ must be a multiple of 4, since every other term is a
multiple of 4.  This implies that $c^4$ is even and so $c$ is also
even.  Substituting $c = 2 c'$ into the previous equation gives:

\begin{equation}
8 a^4 + 4 b^4 + 32 c'^4 = 16 d'^4
\end{equation}

Arguing in the same way, $4 b^4$ must be a multiple of 8, since every
other term is.  Therefore, $b^4$ is even and so $b$ is even.
Substituting $b = 2 b'$ gives:

\begin{equation}
8 a^4 + 64 b'^4 + 32 c'^4 = 16 d'^4
\end{equation}

Finally, $8 a^4$ must be a multiple of 16, $a^4$ must be even, and so
$a$ must also be even.  Therefore $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ must all be
even, as claimed.
\end{solution}
