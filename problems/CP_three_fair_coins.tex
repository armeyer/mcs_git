\begin{problem}
Suppose you flip three fair, mutually independent coins.
Define the following events:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $A$ be the event that \emph{the first} coin is heads.
\item Let $B$ be the event that \emph{the second} coin is heads.
\item Let $C$ be the event that \emph{the third} coin is heads.
\item Let $D$ be the event that \emph{an even number of} coins are heads.
\end{itemize}

\bparts

\ppart Use the four step method to determine the probability space for
this experiment and the probability of each of $A,B,C,D$.

\begin{solution}
The tree is a binary tree with depth 3 and 8 leaves.  The successive
levels branch to show whether or not the successive events $A,B,C$
occur.  By the definitions of the characteristics \emph{fair} and
\emph{independent}, each branch from a vertex is equally likely to be
followed.  So the probability space has, as outcomes, eight length-3
strings of $\heads$'s and $\tails$'s, each of which has probability
$(1/2)^3 = 1/8$.

  Each of the events $A,B,C,D$ are true in four of the outcomes
  and hence has probability 1/2.
\end{solution}

\ppart Show that these events are not mutually independent.

\begin{solution}
\[
\pr{A \cap B \cap C \cap D} = 0 \neq (1/2)^4 = \pr{A} \cdot \pr{B} \cdot
\pr{C} \cdot \pr{D}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Show that they are 3-way independent.

\begin{solution}
3-way independence requires that any subset of three events must be
mutually independent.

Because the coin tosses are mutually independent, we know that $A,B,C$
are mutually independent.  So we must also check that any three events
including $D$ are mutually independent.  By symmetry, we only need to
check whether the three events $A,B,D$ are mutually independent.  First, let's check
\[
\pr{A \cap B \cap D} = \pr{A} \cdot \pr{B} \cdot \pr{D},
\]
which follows because
\[
\pr{A \cap B \cap D} = \pr{\set{HHT}} = \frac{1}{8} = \pr{A} \cdot
\pr{B} \cdot \pr{D}.
\]
We must also check that $A,B,D$ are 2-way (pairwise)
independent.\footnote{The product rule may hold for probabilities of
  three events but not hold for pairs of these events,
  see\bref{CP_three_fair_coins}} We are given that $A$ and $B$ are
independent.  $A$ and $D$ are independent because
\[
\pr{A \cap D} = \pr{\set{HHT,HTH}} = \dfrac{1}{4} = \pr{A} \cdot \pr{D}.
\]
We conclude by symmetry that $B$ and $D$ are also independent.

The above completes the verification that $A,B,C,D$ are 3-way independent.
