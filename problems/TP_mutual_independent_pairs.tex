\begin{problem}
Suppose $A$, $B$ and $C$ are mutually independent events, what about
$A\intersect B$ and $B \union C$?

\begin{solution}
They are never independent except in the trivial case that $\pr{A} =
\pr{C} = 0$ or else $\pr{B}$ is 0 or 1.

This follows because an event is independent of others iff its
complement is independent of the others.  So $A\intersect B$ and $B
\union C$ are independent iff $A\intersect B$ and $\bar{B} \intersect
\bar{C}$ are independent.  But since these last two events are
disjoint, they are independent iff they have probability 1 or 0, which
can only happen if $\pr{A} = \pr{C} = 0$ or $\pr{B}$ is 0 or 1.
\end{solution}
